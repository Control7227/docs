1. COMMENTARY
A. General characteristics

(a) Legislative history

Rule 39 regulates the procedure by which requests for provisional measures are made
and decided in ICSID arbitration. The rule is designed to implement Article 47 of the
Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of
Other States (ICSID Convention’), the master provision where provisional measures

are concerned.

Rule 39 has its origins in the first version of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for
Arbitration Proceedings (ICSID Rules’), which was published in 1968. There have
been three versions of the ICSID Rules since the 1968 rules were issued: 1984, 2003
and 2006. Rule 39 has undergone some renovation in this period. The current Rule
39(6) was introduced in 1984 (originally as Rule 39(5)). As discussed below, the opening
words of Rule 39(1) were amended in 2006, at which time the current Rule 39(5) was
also introduced. The text of Rule 39(2), Rule 39(3) and Rule 39(4) has remained stable
since 1968.

Despite these changes, cases decided under preceding versions of Rule 39 have generally
retained their persuasive value. The notes that accompanied the original version of Rule
39 in the 1968 version of the ICSID Rules remain a useful source of guidance.

(b) Relationship to Article 47 of the ICSID Convention

As explained in the 1968 notes to the ICSID Rules, Rule 39 ‘provides the procedural
framework for implementing Article 47 of the Convention, which is based on the
principle that once a dispute is submitted to arbitration the parties should not take
steps that might aggravate or extend their dispute or prejudice the execution of the
award’.' The 1968 notes therefore signal the original and constant relationship between
Rule 39 and the master provision of the ICSID Convention, Article 47. Essentially, the
relationship is one of substance and form: Article 47 is the primary source of substantive
law for provisional measures, and Rule 39 of the ICSID Rules sets out the procedure
or form in which requests under Article 47 are to be made and adjudicated. Article 47

reads as follows:

RULE 39 — PROVISIONAL MEASURES

Except as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal may, if it considers that the
circumstances so require, recommend any provisional measures which should be taken
to preserve the respective rights of either party.

Each of the key components of Article 47 has a counter-part in Rule 39. For example,
the parties’ autonomy to opt-out of the ICSID Convention provisional measures regime,
reflected in the opening clause of Article 47 (‘[e]xcept as the parties otherwise agree’), is
reflected in Rule 39(6), which allows the parties to agree that provisional measures may
be sought from a ‘judicial or other authority’. Similarly, the key substantive condition
for the recommendation of provisional measures under Article 47 — which is that the
‘circumstances so require’ — is reflected in the Rule 39(1) requirement that the request

for provisional measures specify ‘the circumstances that require such measures’.

(c) Recognised criteria for the grant of provisional measures under Article 47

There is now a significant body of arbitral practice concerning requests under Article
47 of the ICSID Convention. From this jurisprudence, it is possible to identify a set
of criteria for the grant of provisional measures in ICSID arbitration. While this
jurisprudence is discussed separately in the commentary on Article 47 (Chapter 4, para.
4.481), it is relevant for present purposes because it equally informs the operation of
Rule 39 (especially its first item, Rule 39(1)).

Although there remains significant variation in tribunal practice, a survey of the
published authorities shows that some or all of the following conditions must be satisfied

before provisional measures may be recommended under Article 47 and Rule 39:

e the arbitral tribunal must have prima facie jurisdiction,

e there must be a prima facie basis to the claim;

e the requested measures must be necessary to protect the applicant’s rights (or to
preserve the status quo and avoid aggravating the dispute);

e the requested measures must be urgent; and

e the requested measures must be proportional.”

With the exception of the condition of necessity (which is anchored in the Article 47
words ‘circumstances so require’), none of the above-listed conditions has an obvious
textual foundation in Article 47. Rather, most of these conditions have instead emerged
as a consequence of the way ICSID tribunals have interpreted Article 47, particularly
over the last two decades (as recourse to ICSID has increased).?

Chapter 25 PARTICULAR PROCEDURES

Throughout this period, the development of ICSID provisional measures practice was
influenced by provisional measures jurisprudence from outside the ICSID system. In
particular, because Article 47 of the ICSID Convention was inspired by Article 41 of
the Statute of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), ICJ provisional measures practice
has played a significant role in the way ICSID tribunals have interpreted and applied
Article 47 (and Rule 39). In Pey Casado v. Chile, the ICSID Tribunal noted the pedigree
of Article 47 and the particular importance of taking into account provisional measures
decisions by the ICJ and its predecessor, the Permanent Court of International Justice.*
The other main external influence is international commercial arbitration. Although
ICSID arbitration takes place on its own supra-national plane, it is clear that the law
and practice of international commercial arbitration has informed the jurisprudence of

provisional measures under the ICSID Convention.’
B. Timing and content of a request for provisional measures (Rule 39(1))

(a) Request may be made ‘at any time’

Rule 39 is clear that a request for provisional measures may be made ‘[a]t any time after
institution of the proceeding’. The words ‘after institution of’ were introduced in the
2006 amendments to the ICSID Rules. In the original (1968) version of the ICSID
Rules, the opening words of Rule 39(1) read ‘[a]t any time during the proceeding’.
Under Rule 6(2) of the Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and
Arbitration Proceedings, a proceeding under the ICSID Convention is deemed to
have been instituted on the date of registration of the Request for Arbitration by the
Secretary-General of ICSID under Rule 6(1)(a).

The change in temporal reference in Rule 39(1) was intended to compliment the
other change to Rule 39 that was made in 2006.° This was the introduction of Rule
39(5), under which the Secretary-General of ICSID may, before the constitution of
the tribunal, fix time limits for the parties to present observations on a request for
provisional measures (so that the request and observations may be considered by the

tribunal promptly upon its constitution).

In practice, the issue of when a request for provisional measures may be made is likely

to be contentious in three situations: first, when the request is made before the tribunal

RULE 39 — PROVISIONAL MEASURES

is constituted; second, when the request is made in circumstances where there is an
undecided objection to the jurisdiction of the tribunal; and third, when the request for

provisional measures is made in an annulment proceeding.

(i) Request made before the tribunal is constituted

Prior to 2006, there was no established procedure in place to deal with requests for
provisional measures made prior to the constitution of the tribunal. However, with the
introduction of sub-rule (5) in 2006, there is now a mechanism for pre-constitution
requests, i.e. the requesting party may file its request before the tribunal is constituted
and ask the Secretary-General of ICSID to fix time limits for the parties to present
observations on the request, so that the request and observations may be considered by

the tribunal promptly upon its constitution.

This advance briefing mechanism is addressed further in the commentary on Rule 39(5)

(para. 25.73).

(ii) Request made while the jurisdiction of the tribunal is contested

Where the request is made while a jurisdictional objection is pending, the Rule 39(1)
words ‘at any time’ have been taken as confirmation that an ICSID tribunal may hear
and grant requests for provisional measures even where there is a pending objection
to its jurisdiction. It is relatively rare to see tribunals expressly refer to Rule 39(1) in
this context. One example of direct reference to Rule 39(1) is the case of Valle Verde v.
Venezuela,’ where the Tribunal noted that:

[s]ince ‘any time’ includes the time before the Tribunal has made a determination on
jurisdiction, it follows that it must be possible to consider a request for provisional
measures before ruling on jurisdiction provided that the Tribunal is satisfied that it has
prima facie jurisdiction.®

Where provisional measures are sought while a jurisdictional objection is pending
determination, the tribunal need only satisfy itself that ‘there is, prima facie, a basis on
which the Tribunal’s jurisdiction might be established’;’ or, in the words of the Tribunal
in Hydro v. Albania, ‘all that is required is that the provisions invoked appear prima facie

to afford a basis for jurisdiction to decide the merits’."°

Chapter 25 PARTICULAR PROCEDURES

There is debate regarding the extent to which the respondent’s objections bear on the analysis
of prima facie jurisdiction. On the basis of modern ICJ practice, it may be argued that the
tribunal must examine its jurisdiction in fofo, taking into account not only the putative of
foundation of jurisdiction but also any legal complications that may arise, as specified by
the respondent.’ However, ICJ case law is clear that, in provisional measures contexts, the
jurisdictional threshold is low and the benefit of the doubt is to be given to the claimant.”

(iii) Request made during annulment proceedings

It continues to be debated whether an annulment committee is competent to recommend
provisional measures. The uncertainty arises out of the fact that Article 52(4) of the
ICSID Convention (which identifies the provisions of the ICSID Convention that
shall apply mutatis mutandis to proceedings before an annulment committee) does not
refer to Article 47. However, the equivalent provision of the ICSID Rules (Rule 53)
is unrestricted, stating in general terms that ‘[t]he provisions of these Rules shall apply
mutatis mutandis to any procedure relating to the interpretation, revision or annulment

of an award and to the decision of the Tribunal or Committee’.

Proponents of the provisional measures power of an annulment committee often refer
to Enron v. Argentina, where the Committee noted that ‘ICSID Arbitration Rule
53 appears to be sufficiently broadly worded to confer on an ad hoc committee the
power to recommend provisional measures, contained in ICSID Arbitration Rule
39’.4 Arguments based on inherent powers may also be made,” at least in so far as the
measures are directed at preserving the integrity of the committee’s own processes.

Opponents of the provisional measures power of annulment committees tend to refer
to Libananco v. Turkey,'° where the Committee saw the absence of any reference to
Article 47 in Article 52(4) as providing ‘considerable support for the view that the

Committee is not competent to recommend provisional measures’.””

(b) Rights to be preserved
Under Rule 39(1) a party may request provisional measures ‘for the preservation of its
rights’. This conveys the fundamental purpose of provisional measures in the ICSID

RULE 39 — PROVISIONAL MEASURES

system: to preserve rights while the final determination of the dispute is pending before
the tribunal.

The wording of Rule 39(1) — namely the possessive pronoun ‘its’ — makes it clear that the
rights concerned are those of the applicant, and not the rights of third parties. However,
not all of an applicant’s rights will be amenable to preservation through provisional

measures.

It is generally accepted that the rights in question must bear a re/ation to the dispute as
defined by the claims and the relief sought.'* Some earlier authorities (notably Amco Asia
v. Indonesia’’) go further and require that the relevant right forms the subject-matter
of the dispute, but it has been noted that this restrictive approach is not necessarily
consistent with what the drafters of the ICSID Convention intended.”

Certainly, the class of rights eligible for protection under Rule 39 is not limited to the
substantive rights in dispute. It is well established that certain procedural rights may
also be amenable to protection through provisional measures.’ Well-known examples

922

include the ‘self-standing’”® rights to the preservation of the status quo” and the non-

aggravation of the dispute.**

Chapter 25 PARTICULAR PROCEDURES

Other procedural rights, such as the preservation of the effectiveness of a future award,”
the preservation of evidence,”* and the exclusivity of ICSID arbitration under Article
26 of the ICSID Convention,” have also been afforded interim protection (either
individually or collectively under the rubric of ‘procedural integrity”*). There is a general
trend towards increased invocation and recognition of procedural rights in provisional

measures contexts.

The present tense of Rule 39(1) (‘provisional measures for the preservation of its
rights’) has been read as excluding from protection rights that are ‘hypothetical’ or ‘to
be created in the future’.””? However, this construction has been challenged by some
tribunals. For example, in RSM v. S¢ Lucia, the claimant opposed St Lucia’s application
for provisional measures (security for costs) on the basis (inzer alia) that the right was
purely hypothetical and, therefore, not a ‘right to be preserved’. The majority of the
Tribunal rejected this argument, instead characterising the State’s right as a procedural
right to claim costs which could be protected as a measure necessary to ensure the

‘integrity of the proceedings as a whole’.*”

(c) Binding nature of provisional measures recommendations
Rule 39(1) contemplates provisional measures being ‘recommended’ by the tribunal,
rather than ordered.*! This language tracks Article 47 of the ICSID Convention, which

also uses the word ‘recommend’.

The drafting history of the ICSID Convention shows that the term ‘recommend’ was
carefully chosen. In the Preliminary Draft of the ICSID Convention, the provisional
measures article spoke of tribunals being empowered to ‘prescribe’ provisional
measures; in the First Draft of the ICSID Convention, the verb ‘prescribe’ was
retained and a sub-item was added empowering the tribunal to fix a penalty for failure

to comply with provisional measures.*’ Ultimately, this robust wording was opposed

and the verb ‘recommend’ was adopted as a compromise.**

Despite this, since the 1999 provisional measures decision in Maffezini v. Spain, a fairly
stable line of authority has emerged to the effect that, despite the wording of Rule 39
(and Article 47), ICSID tribunals have the power to order provisional measures and
such orders are legally binding on the parties.* In affirming the power to order, the
Tribunal in Transglobal Green Energy v. Panama noted this jurisprudence constante and
added that, in the Spanish version of Rule 39, the verb ‘dictar (equivalent to ‘order’)
is used.*° A recent illustration of the Maffezini-led line of authority can be found in
PNGSDP v. Papua New Guinea, where the Tribunal noted this line of authority and
concluded that ‘[t]he phrase “recommend,” in the context of the [ICSID] Convention,

means “order” or “direct”’.*”

In light of this jurisprudence, it is not unusual to see the parties agree (or at least not
dispute**) that the tribunal has the power to order provisional measures — in which
case the issue may not fall for consideration by the tribunal. However, the ‘power to
order’ question does still arise from time to time. When confronted with this issue,
the tribunal may exercise judicial economy. For example, in Millicom v. Senegal,” the
Tribunal was satisfied that due to the nature of the relief sought ‘the question may

remain undecided’.”

An example of a tribunal taking a clear position against the power to order can be found
in Caratube v. Kazakhstan, where the Tribunal noted in passing that ‘according to Rule

39, the Tribunal cannot order, but can only recommend provisional measures in ICSID

proceedings’.*' A rare example of a strong statement against the power to order can be

found in RSM v. St Lucia, where the dissenting arbitrator (Judge Nottingham) said ‘[n
g g &

o matter how many times it is repeated, an order is not a recommendation. Only in the

jurisprudence of an imaginary Wonderland would this make sense’.”

In terms of form, the current trend is to issue the recommendation as a ‘Decision,
although simple procedural orders are also widely used. Perhaps surprisingly, the title

‘Recommendation is rarely used in practice.*

(d) Required content of a provisional measures request

Rule 39(1) requires that a request for provisional measures ‘specify the rights to
be preserved, the measures the recommendation of which is requested, and the
circumstances that require such measures’. Referring to the content of Rule 39(1), the
Tribunal in BSG Resources v. Guinea observed that ‘ICSID tribunals have interpreted
these requirements to mean that provisional measures must (i) serve to protect certain
rights of the applicant, (ii) be urgent, and (iii) be necessary, which implies the existence

of a risk of irreparable or substantial harm’.*

The use of the word ‘shall in Rule 39(1) indicates that the content stipulated is
mandatory. This has been observed by a number of tribunals. For example, in Caratube v.
Kazakhstan, the Tribunal noted that a request for provisional measures must specify the
three aspects mentioned in the last sentence of Rule 39(1).” Where a request does not
contain the minimum content required under Rule 39(1), the request may be opposed

on the basis that it is not admissible.

(i) Specification of rights to be preserved
The requirement that the applicant ‘specify the rights to be preserved’ must be read in
conjunction with the first clause of Rule 39(1), which makes it clear that the rights

amenable to protection through provisional measures are the rights of the applicant.

The burden is on the applicant to identify the relevant rights in its request for provisional
measures. Best practice is to specify both the rights and how each right relates to the

dispute as defined by the claims and the relief sought.” In practical terms, this means
the applicant must articulate how the right to be preserved ‘relate[s] to the applicant’s
ability to have its claims and requests for relief in the arbitration fairly considered and
decided by the arbitral tribunal and for any arbitral decision which grants the relief
sought to be effective and capable of carrying out’.*”

(ii) Specification of measures requested

Under Rule 39(1), the applicant also has the burden of specifying the precise measures
sought. Neither Rule 39 nor Article 47 of the ICSID Convention limits the types
of measures available. The types of provisional measures that may be granted by an
ICSID tribunal include a wide range of measures, which depend on the particular

circumstances of the case and the rights that are sought to be protected.*
Examples of provisional measures that are commonly sought under Rule 39 include:

e orders for the preservation of the status quo,

e orders directing performance of a contract or other legal obligations,
e orders for the preservation of evidence;

e orders enforcing confidentiality obligations; and

e orders for security for costs.”

Normally, the measures sought will be itemised in the final section of the applicant’s
request document, much like a prayer for relief in a statement of claim or claimant’s

memorial.

Although it is well settled that ICSID tribunals have the power to order provisional
measures, applicants will often request that the tribunal ‘recommend or order’ the
provisional measures sought. This approach is prudent as, on a strict reading of Rule
39(1), a request will not meet the minimum content requirements unless the measures

requested are framed in terms of a recommendation.

(iii) Specification of circumstances that require provisional measures
Rule 39(1) also requires that the applicant specify the ‘circumstances that require

such measures’. It is widely accepted that these words (and the corresponding words

Chapter 25 PARTICULAR PROCEDURES

‘circumstances so require’ in Article 47) import a test of necessity for provisional
measures. A review of the published decisions shows that, in order to meet the test
for necessity, the applicant must satisfy two main elements: harm and urgency. The
applicant must satisfy these elements ‘with sufficient likelihood, without however
having to actually prove the facts underlying them’.°

(1) Harm

Many ICSID tribunals (notably the Tribunal in Occidental Petroleum Corporation
v. Ecuador’) have taken the view that the element of necessity entails (or implies*)
consideration of whether the actions in question will cause ‘irreparable harm’, an

approach that is consistent with ICJ authority.

If the tribunal applies the ‘irreparable harm’ standard, it will likely focus on the
sufficiency of monetary damages as a remedy, especially if damages are the only remedy
that the claimant seeks.** The main exception to the ‘sufficiency of monetary damages’
rule seems to be the destruction of the investment: where the actions in question would,
if not restrained by provisional measures, effectively bring an end to the investor's
business, then the harm feared may well be ‘irreparable’ notwithstanding the fact that

the loss could (at least in theory) be measured in money.*

However, a number of ICSID tribunals have questioned the application of the

‘irreparable harm standard. For example, in Perenco v. Ecuador, the Tribunal concluded

influential in this area. For example, some investment treaties provide that a respondent State may always choose to pay
monetary damages in lieu of restitution. In some cases, Tribunals have relied on these provisions to limit the availability
of provisional measures (see e.g. Bear Creek Mining (n 38) Procedural Order No. 2 Regarding Claimants’ Request for
Provisional Measures (19 April 2015) para. 72).

RULE 39 — PROVISIONAL MEASURES

that Article 49 of the ICSID Convention ‘does not lay down a test of irreparable loss

and the authorities do not warrant so narrow a construction’.”®

In PNGSDP »v. Papua New Guinea, the Tribunal considered that ‘the term “irreparable”
harm is properly understood as requiring a showing of a material risk of serious or grave
damage to the requesting party, and not harm that is literally “irreparable” in what is

sometimes regarded as the narrow common law sense of the term’.””

Arbitrators who reject the ‘irreparable harm’ standard tend to prefer a formulation
of either ‘substantial prejudice’ or ‘significant’ harm*® — both of which impose lower
thresholds for the applicant. The various formulations of the harm standard, and the
authorities underpinning them, were the subject of considered analysis by the Tribunal
in CEMEX v. Venezuela.”

Whether the ‘irreparable harm standard is applicable, and if so how it is applied in terms
of burden, will vary depending on the purpose of the provisional measures sought. For
example, it is arguable that measures directed at preserving the procedural integrity
of the arbitration automatically satisfy this standard, as harm to a party’s procedural
rights (especially with respect to access to evidence) cannot be remedied by an award
of damages.®

It may also be possible to argue that because the purpose of the provisional measures
is to preserve the status guo and prevent aggravation of the dispute, the tribunal need
not consider the question of harm (at least not in the context of necessity).*' There is,
however, a line of ICJ authority to support the argument that even where the provisional
measures in question are directed at preventing aggravation of the dispute, ‘irreparable

harm’ must still be shown.”

Chapter 25 PARTICULAR PROCEDURES

An alternative formulation of the harm aspect of necessity links it to the balance of
convenience, resulting in what is sometimes expressed as a ‘balance of harm’. On
this interpretation — which was adopted by the Tribunal in Burlington v. Ecuador™ —
the harm feared by the requesting party must substantially outweigh the harm that is
likely to be suffered by the party against whom the measure is directed (if the measure
is granted). In Hydro v. Albania, the ‘balance of harm’ was addressed as part of the
Tribunal’s analysis of proportionality.®

(2) Urgency
Urgency is the temporal dimension of necessity. Even though it does not feature in
the text of Rule 39 (or Article 47 of the ICSID Convention), urgency is the most

important consideration (even a sine qua non®) for the granting of provisional measures.

Itis generally accepted in ICSID arbitration that an application for provisional measures
will be urgent where it entails ‘a question that cannot await the outcome of the award
on the merits’,*’ or where ‘action prejudicial to the rights of either party is likely to be
taken before [a] final decision is taken [in the arbitration]’.© This understanding, which
equates with the notion of periculum in mora in civil law systems, reflects ICJ provisional

measures practice.”

In circumstances where provisional measures are sought to protect the procedural
integrity of the arbitration, it may be argued that the measures are ‘urgent by definition.”
This argument will be most appealing where the measures relate to the preservation
of evidence, as (in the words of the Tribunal in Quiborax v. Bolivia) ‘the question of
whether a Party has the opportunity to present its case or rely on the integrity of specific

evidence is essential to (and therefore cannot await) the rendering of an award on the

merits’.”! Quiborax v. Bolivia and other cases (including City Oriente v. Ecuador’)
arguably signal the emergence of a notion of ‘axiomatic urgency’? in ICSID provisional

measures jurisprudence.
C. Priority to be given to provisional measures requests (Rule 39(2))

Rule 39(2) requires that the tribunal give priority to the consideration of a request for
provisional measures. The use of the word ‘shall’ in Rule 39(2) signals that this priority
is mandatory.

Compliance with Rule 39(1) will not normally be problematic. Requests for provisional
measures tend to be adjudicated reasonably quickly, with most tribunals rendering a
decision within two to four months after a request is filed.’* Where the president of
the tribunal considers that the request for provisional measures is especially urgent, he
or she may propose to take a decision on the request by correspondence between the
members of the tribunal under Rule 16(2).

One of the rare situations in which Rule 39(2) may be difficult to satisfy is where there
is a parallel objection under Rule 41(5) on the basis that the claim is ‘manifestly without
legal merit’. The problem arises out of the fact that Rule 41(5) requires that the tribunal
must issue its decision on the objection at the first session or promptly thereafter. In
such situations, a tribunal will normally have to determine the Rule 41(5) application
before dealing with the motion on provisional measures.” This is the approach that the
Tribunal took in PNGSDP v. Papua New Guinea, where the respondent State filed an
application under Rule 41(5) two days after the claimant filed its request for provisional
measures.”° Similarly, in MOL v. Croatia,” the respondent State filed a motion under

Rule 41(5) and sought provisional measures (in the form of a stay of the proceedings) in

the alternative. The MOL Tribunal ruled on the Rule 41(5) motion and decided to keep

the question of provisional measures under review.”
D. Provisional measures on the tribunal's own initiative (Rule 39(3))

(a) Recommendations proprio motu
The first sentence of Rule 39(3) confirms that the tribunal may recommend provisional
measures on its own initiative or recommend measures other than those specified in a

request made by one of the parties.

As provisional measures are almost always requested by a party, the tribunal’s Rule 39(3)

power to recommend provisional measures proprio motu is rarely exercised in practice.

It is debatable whether, in recommending provisional measures proprio motu under Rule
39(3), the tribunal must still give each party an opportunity to present its observations
(as required by Rule 39(4)).” In Perenco v. Ecuador,” the Tribunal displayed some
resistance to the notion that Rule 39(3) is subject to Rule 39(4), but ultimately
concluded that the issue was moot because the parties had in fact been heard.*?

In Border Timbers v. Zimbabwe,” the President of the Tribunal, faced with an urgent
application for provisional measures, indicated that he considered the proprio motu
power in Rule 39 was subject to Rule 39(4) and that he was therefore ‘not in a position
to recommend provisional measures prior to consulting with the parties further’.®
However, the circumstances of the case — particularly the fears of ‘intimidation and
violence’ expressed in the application** — were such that the President concluded it
was appropriate to make certain directions to preserve the s¢atus quo ‘pending further

observations of the parties’.

RULE 39 — PROVISIONAL MEASURES

(b) Recommendations of measures not requested
It is considerably more common for tribunals to exercise the power given to them under
the second limb of Rule 39(3), which is to recommend measures other than those

specified in a request.

A common example is where a sfatus quo or non-aggravation order is sought by one

party and the tribunal grants the order against both sides equally.

Another example is where the tribunal orders the parties to confer on measures to
preserve the status quo. For example, in Hydro v. Albania, the Tribunal granted the
applicant’s request for a recommendation that Albania suspend certain criminal
proceedings and related extradition proceedings. Although no request for conferral was
made by the applicants, the Tribunal invited the parties to confer on steps necessary to
preserve assets of the claimants that had been seized by the Albanian authorities.*°

E. Modification or revocation of provisional measures (Rule 39(3))

Under the second sentence of Rule 39(3), the tribunal may at any time modify or revoke

its recommendations.

In practice, this power is most likely to be exercised where the measures are temporally
limited to the occurrence of a particular event (upon the happening of which the
measures are to dissolve), or where the orders include an element of reporting by the

requesting party (with failure to report being a ground for revocation of the measures).

Unlike the exercise of the proprio motu power conferred by the first sentence of Rule
39(3), it is clear from Rule 39(4) that the tribunal may only exercise its power to modify
or revoke provisional measures after having given each party an opportunity to make

observations.
F. Right of the parties to present observations (Rule 39(4))

(a) General requirement of procedural fairness
Under Rule 39(4), the tribunal shall only recommend provisional measures, or modify
or revoke its recommendations, after giving each party an opportunity of presenting its

observations.

Chapter 25 PARTICULAR PROCEDURES

Rule 39(4) reflects the general principle of audi alteram partem, adherence of which is
fundamental to procedural fairness. Rule 39(4) also prohibits the granting of provisional
measures completely ex parte, in a similar manner to Article 61(8) of the ICJ Rules of
the Court (1946).*”

(b) Meaning of ‘observations’

Rule 39(4) refers to ‘observations’ and so best practice is for the parties to describe their
submissions in this way. Although the term ‘observations’ implies a certain collegiate
informality, the reality is that provisional measures applications are often more like
hard-fought mini-trials, with detailed legal pleadings and supporting evidence

(including witness statements).

In practice, the briefing sequence comprises two, and often three, steps: the request
(in the form of an application), the responding party’s observations (in the form of a
reply), and (somewhat less frequently) the applicant’s rejoinder. More often than not,
a hearing will be held.** In the absence of a hearing, the application will be decided on
the papers.”

While it is not unusual for losing parties to complain that they have been denied the
right to be heard, following this standard briefing process will normally be sufficient to
satisfy the tribunal’s obligations under Rule 39(4). Difficulties may arise when critical
developments occur, such as further adverse action by the party against which the
measures are sought. In this situation, it is not unusual for ‘updates’ to be provided by the
requesting party outside the normal briefing sequence. As these are usually unsolicited
submissions, it will be a matter for the tribunal whether such materials are taken into

account and, if they are, whether the other side should be given a right to respond.

(c) Relationship to Rule 39(3)

As noted above, the main situation in which the tribunal’s obligation to hear the parties
becomes contentious is where the tribunal recommends provisional measures proprio
motu under Rule 39(3). It is not clear whether, in the exercise of this power, the tribunal
must give the parties an opportunity to make observations. There is limited practice on

this issue.

As noted above, the reasoning of the Tribunal in Perenco v. Ecuador provides some
support to the proposition that, at least in circumstances where giving the respondent

the right to make observations could give rise to a risk of unilateral action that defeats

the purpose of the measures, the tribunal need not give the parties a right to be heard.”
G. Request for provisional measures before the tribunal is constituted (Rule 39(5))

(a) Background
Under Rule 39(5), the Secretary-General of ICSID can set a briefing schedule pending
the constitution of the arbitral tribunal so that the request for provisional measures can

be heard immediately thereafter. This advance programming mechanism was added in
the 2006 changes to the ICSID Rules.

In the Working Paper that the ICSID Secretariat published in advance of the 2006
amendments, the following explanation was provided for the introduction of this

mechanism:

The suggested changes [to Rule 39] introduce a procedure for the expedited filing of
requests for provisional measures, and of all the observations of the parties on such a
request, prior to the constitution of a tribunal. Such a procedure would reduce delay and
ensure that the tribunal is able to consider the request once it is constituted, especially
where the measures are urgently required.”!

As noted above, the 2006 changes included the amendment of the opening words of
Rule 39(1), to clarify that a party may request provisional measures at any time after

the proceedings are instituted (i.e. once the Request for Arbitration is registered by

ICSID).

(b) Conditions for the exercise of the Secretary-General’s pre-constitution briefing
power

There are two pre-conditions to the Secretary-General’s exercise of the power conferred
by Rule 39(5): first, there must be a request for provisional measures pursuant to Rule
39(1); second, there must be an application (by either party) to the Secretary-General

to fix a briefing schedule for the parties to provide their observations on the request.

As to the first condition, Rule 39(5) requires that the request for provisional measures
be made ‘pursuant to’ Rule 39(1). Thus, before the Secretary-General can exercise his
or her pre-constitution briefing power under Rule 39(5), there must be a provisional

measures request that contains the content required under Rule 39(1), ie. the request

must ‘specify the rights to be preserved, the measures the recommendation of which is

requested, and the circumstances that require such measures’.

As to the second condition, it is notable that the request for a pre-constitution briefing
schedule may be made by ‘either party’, not just the party requesting provisional
measures. However, it will usually be the requesting party that makes the application to

the Secretary-General.

(c) Form of application for pre-constitution briefing schedule

Rule 39(5) does not specify the form in which the application to the Secretary-General
is to be made. In the usual case where the party making the application to the Secretary-
General is also the party requesting provisional measures, the application will often be
made in the request for provisional measures itself (under a separate heading that refers
specifically to Rule 39(5) and tracks the language of the rule, asking the Secretary-

General to fix time limits for the parties to present observations on the request).

Alternatively, the application under Rule 39(5) may be made in the form of a covering
letter attached to the request for provisional measures (although, in this approach,
it is good practice to include in the request for provisional measures a note that an

application has been made under Rule 39(5)).
H. Provisional measures requested from a judicial or other authority (Rule 39(6))

Rule 39(6) preserves party autonomy, allowing the parties to agree that applications for

provisional measures may be made to a ‘judicial or other authority’.

Rule 39(6) was added in 1984 (originally as Rule 39(5)) to put an end to the debate

RULE 39 — PROVISIONAL MEASURES

Rule 39(6) agreements are usually found in contracts (such as natural resources
concessions and investment agreements). Provided the relevant term is clear, such

agreements will not usually be controversial.

However, issues may arise where the parties’ consent to arbitrate under the ICSID
Convention arises from the investor’s acceptance of an offer of arbitration made by
the host State in an investment treaty or national law. In this context, there may not be
scope for a Rule 39(6) agreement. This is because Rule 39(6) requires that the carve-out
in favour of a ‘judicial or other authority’ be ‘stipulated’ by the parties ‘in the agreement
recording their consent’ and, in this situation, the terms of the relevant agreement are
unilaterally crafted (by the offering State). On the conventional theory of offer and
acceptance that underpins consent in modern investment treaty arbitration, the investor

only has two courses of action available: accept those terms (and arbitrate) or not.

In theory, it would be possible for the investor to condition its acceptance of the State’s
offer by stipulating that provisional measures may be sought from a ‘judicial or other
authority’. However, such a stipulation would require the express acceptance of the
offering State in order to be effective for the purposes of Rule 39(6).

2. DRAFT RULE 51 —- SECURITY FOR COSTS

1. A party may request that the Tribunal order the other party to provide security
for the costs of the proceeding and determine the appropriate terms for provision
of the security.

2. The following procedure shall apply:

(a) the request shall specify the circumstances that require security for costs;

(b) the Tribunal shall fix time limits for written or oral submissions, as required,
on the request;

(c) ifa party requests security for costs before the constitution of the Tribunal,
the Secretary-General shall fix time limits for written submissions on the
request, so that the Tribunal may consider the request promptly upon its
constitution; and

(d) the Tribunal shall issue its decision on the request within 30 days after the
latest of:

(i) the constitution of the Tribunal;
(ii) the last written submission on the request; or
(iii) the last oral submission on the request.

3. In determining whether to order a party to provide security for costs, the
Tribunal shall consider the party’s ability to comply with an adverse decision on
costs and any other relevant circumstances.

4. Ifa party fails to comply with an order for security for costs, the Tribunal may
suspend the proceeding until the security is provided. If the proceeding is

suspended for more than 90 days, the Tribunal may, after consulting with the
parties, order the discontinuance of the proceeding.

5. A party must promptly disclose any material change in the circumstances upon
which the Tribunal ordered security for costs.

6. The Tribunal may at any time modify or revoke its order for security for costs, on
its own initiative or upon a party’s request.

A. General characteristics

(a) Legislative history

The ICSID Secretariat has proposed Draft Rule 51 as a means of establishing a
separate regime for security for costs, meaning orders that require a party to provide a
security to cover the estimated costs that the other party will incur in the proceeding,
including arbitration costs and legal fees. It is one of the amendments that has been
proposed following the review of the ICSID Rules that was launched in October 2016.
Further background to Draft Rule 51 is provided in the Working Paper published by
the ICSID Secretariat on 1 August 2018. At the time of writing, the review process is
yet to be completed and so none of the proposed amendments have come into effect.
It is therefore possible that Draft Rule 51 will not be adopted or will be adopted with

modified wording.

(b) Relationship to Rule 39 and prior jurisprudence

To date, requests for security for costs have been treated as a form of provisional measure,
to which Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Rules apply.
Within this legal framework, security for costs developed as a specific branch of ICSID
provisional measures jurisprudence, with a sui generis test. The development of ICSID
jurisprudence in this area accelerated in 2014, when, in RSM Production Corporation v.
Saint Lucia,”® an ICSID tribunal ordered security for costs for the first time. Since then,
an order for security for costs is only known to have been issued in one other ICSID
case (Manuel Garcia Armas et al. v. Venezuela’’), despite numerous requests by States.

The introduction of a ‘new stand-alone provision”

for security for costs is a significant
step that raises a number of important questions of law and policy for users of the
ICSID system. The main policy issues are identified in the Working Paper. One of
the threshold legal questions will be what effect the introduction of a stand-alone rule

has on the persuasive value of security for costs decisions previously made by ICSID

96 RSM (n 30) Decision on Saint Lucia’s Request for Security of Costs (13 August 2014).

RULE 39 — PROVISIONAL MEASURES

tribunals under Rule 39. The practical significance of this question lies in the fact
that decisions under Rule 39 have generally identified security for costs as only being
available in ‘exceptional circumstances” — a key component of the sui generis test —
whereas Draft Rule 51 does not contain any express wording to indicate that such a
high threshold must be met. Indeed, the Working Paper suggests the drafting of Draft
Rule 51 was informed by calls to make security for costs ‘more readily available’,'” for
which a lower threshold would be necessary.

In debates on this question, much will turn on the characterisation of Draft Rule 51.If 25.89

Draft Rule 51 is viewed as an effective codification of (at least some of) the principles
recognised in security for costs jurisprudence, it may be argued that the precedential
value of decisions under Rule 39 is reduced and the sui generis test no longer applies to
applications under the new provision. Supporting such an argument is the fact that the
Working Paper notes that codification was one of the motivations behind Draft Rule
51, recalling the requests of several States that ‘the parties’ right to request security for
costs should be codified, either as a provisional measure or separately’.'°' On the other
hand, there are certain principles that, whilst recognised in Rule 39 jurisprudence, do
not feature in the text of Draft Rule 51 — and the ‘exceptional circumstances’ principle is
arguably one. At least in respect of these principles, it may be argued that, to the extent
Draft Rule 51 does not posit a contrary rule, previous authorities for their application
should retain their value. Supporting this argument is the fact that the Working Paper
emphasises that, consistent with Rule 39 jurisprudence, a lack of assets alone will not
justify an order for security for costs and ‘there must be other circumstances present,
such as a history of noncompliance with legal orders or bad faith’ — an explanation
that suggests a higher than usual threshold will still apply under the proposed new

provision.

Ultimately, parties will continue to rely on security for costs decisions made under Rule
39 for some time after Draft Rule 51 comes into effect. However, assuming the new
rule comes into force, it will likely be regularly invoked by respondent States, with
the result that a body of case law specific to Draft Rule 51 should emerge reasonably
quickly.

Chapter 25 PARTICULAR PROCEDURES

(c) Relationship to Article 47 of the ICSID Convention

As noted above, Draft Rule 51 is intended to be a ‘stand-alone provision for security for
costs. This suggests that the new rule is meant to operate entirely independently from
the provisional measures regime controlled by Article 47 of the ICSID Convention.
The Working Paper suggests that the motivation for this approach is to free security
for costs from the textual constraints of Article 47 and, by extension, isolate security for
costs from the wider body of provisional measures jurisprudence (thereby lowering the
threshold). The key textual distinction lies in the fact that Draft Rule 51 proposes to
give tribunals the power to ‘order’ security for costs, whereas Article 47 of the ICSID
Convention speaks of the tribunal’s power to ‘recommend’ provisional measures. ‘The
Working Paper notes that ‘[i]f security for costs is included in a separate provision that
is not required to align with Article 47, the use of the term “order” would be consistent
with the Convention’.’” The other reason for this textual difference is that use of the
term ‘order’ is needed to support the non-compliance mechanism in Draft Rule 51(4),
discussed below. The detachment of the security for costs mechanism from Article 47

also has implications for the operation of the mechanism at the annulment level.

D. Application of Draft Rule 51 in annulment proceedings

Article 52(4) of the ICSID Convention provides that certain provisions of the
Convention will apply mutatis mutandis in annulment proceedings. However, because
Article 47 is not one of the articles referred to in Article 52(4), there has for some
time been a debate as to whether an annulment committee has the power to grant
provisional measures — including security for costs. In some cases, it has been suggested
that security for costs orders may be granted in the exercise of an annulment committee’s
inherent powers, though only in an ‘extreme case’, and contrary arguments may be
made. The uncertainty in this area will be resolved by the amended Rules. Because
the security for costs regime will be detached from the provisional measures regime
— such that it is governed by a rule rather than an article of the ICSID Convention —
the lack of reference to Article 47 in Article 52(4) of the ICSID Convention will no
longer present a barrier to annulment committees ordering security for costs. By way
of Draft Rule 66(1), which provides that the Rules apply, with necessary modifications,
to annulment procedures, parties will be able to invoke Draft Rule 51 at the annulment
level. This is a significant change, especially considering the already unique economics
of an annulment proceeding (in which Rule 14(3)(e) stipulates that ‘the applicant
[for annulment] shall be solely responsible for making the payments requested by the
Secretary-General’ to cover the costs of the ad hoc committee and ICSID). Where the

RULE 39 — PROVISIONAL MEASURES

applicant for annulment is a claimant with limited assets, an application under Draft

Rule 51 may well raise access to justice issues.
B. Procedure for security for costs

(a) Content of a security for costs request

The only mandatory requirement for the content of a request for security for costs is set
out in Draft Rule 51(2)(a), which states that ‘the request shall specify the circumstances
that require security for costs’. Although the use of the verb ‘specify’ implies that a
reasonable degree of precision is required on this aspect of the request, Draft Rule 51(2)
(a) does not provide any further guidance on the ‘circumstances’ that will warrant an
order for security for costs. The Working Paper makes it clear that this was a deliberate
drafting choice, being intended to ensure that tribunals have ‘the flexibility they will
need to address a vast range of factual circumstances’. But other parts of Draft Rule
51 do give some important indications — particularly Draft Rule 51(3), under which the
mandatory considerations for the tribunal include ‘the party’s ability to comply with an

adverse decision on costs and any other relevant circumstances’.

Reading Draft Rule 51(2)(a) in the light of Draft Rule 51(3), the requesting party
should include in its request proof that the other party will not be able to comply with
an adverse costs order (as required under the first limb of Draft Rule 51(3)). Critically,
the requesting party should also identify the ‘other relevant circumstances’ that justify
security (as required under the second limb of Draft Rule 51(3)).

The Working Paper explains that words ‘other relevant circumstances’ are a ‘broad

formulation!”

intended to allow the tribunal to consider any factors weighing for or
against security. These factors will of course vary from case to case. Certainly, a record
of non-compliance with ICSID costs orders will be relevant and will weigh in favour of
security being ordered, as it did in RSM v. St Lucia. The Working Paper confirms this.”
Relying on RSM and the more recent Armas case, it may also be argued that the fact
the claimant has entered into a Third-Party Funding (TPF) arrangement is a ‘relevant
circumstance’ for the purposes of Draft Rule 51(3) — though the Working Paper stresses
that ‘the mere fact of TPF, without relevant evidence of an inability to comply with an
adverse costs decision, will continue to be insufficient to obtain an order for security for

costs under proposed [Draft Rule 51]’.!°* It is to be noted here that Draft Rule 21 will

25.97

25.98

Chapter 25 PARTICULAR PROCEDURES

require a party to ICSID proceedings to provide ‘written notice disclosing that it has
third-party funding and the name of the third-party funder’. If a party has TPF but
fails to give the required disclosure, that may be a relevant circumstance in security for
costs.

Two further requirements for the content of the request may be discerned from the
master provision, Draft Rule 51(1): first, it is incumbent on the requesting party to
specify the quantum of the security it seeks (‘the costs of the proceeding’); second,
the requesting party must also specify the form and conditions of the security it seeks,
so that the tribunal is able to ‘determine the appropriate terms for provision of the
security’. As to the quantum (or scope) of security, the request can only cover the ‘costs
of the proceeding’, which under Draft Rule 19(2) comprise the legal fees and expenses
incurred by the parties in connection with the proceeding, the fees and expenses of the
Tribunal, and the administrative charges and other direct costs of ICSID. As to the
‘appropriate terms of the security’, the Working Paper explains that ‘relevant “terms”
could include, for example, the form of security (e.g., a bank guarantee or a letter of
credit), the duration of the security, the issuer of the security, other specific requirements,
and the party that is to bear the cost of the security’.’”

(b) Briefing schedule for submissions on the request

Consistent with tribunal practice under Rule 39, Draft Rule 51(2)(b) requires the
tribunal to ‘fix time limits for written or oral submissions, as required, on the request’.
Draft Rule 51(2)(b) does not prescribe a minimum number of rounds of written
submissions, but there must be at least one (otherwise there would be a departure from
the fundamental right to be heard); after that, it is a matter for the tribunal whether
to accept further written submissions on the request. Similarly, Draft Rule 51(2)(b)
does not require an oral hearing on the request — the words ‘as required’ signal that it
is a matter for the tribunal (in its discretion) to determine whether an oral hearing is

necessary.

Draft Rule 51 also provides for the programming of written submissions by the
Secretary-General of ICSID where the request for security for costs is made before the
tribunal is constituted. The Secretary-General is mandated to perform this function by
Draft Rule 51(2)(c). Though worded slightly differently, Draft Rule 51(2)(c) reflects the
pre-constitution briefing mechanism for provisional measures in Rule 39(5) introduced
when the Rules were last amended in 2006. Notably, Draft Rule 51(2)(c) refers only to

‘written submissions on the request’, meaning the Secretary-General does not have the

power to schedule oral submissions (hearings) on security for costs. However, where
a briefing schedule is fixed by the Secretary-General under Draft Rule 51(2)(c), the
tribunal (once constituted) is free to program further submissions, written and oral.

110

This is emphasised in the Working Paper.

(c) Timing of the tribunal’s decision on the request

Draft Rule 51(2)(d) provides that the tribunal shall issue its decision on the request
within 30 days after the latest of: (1) the constitution of the tribunal; (ii) the last written
submission on the request; or (iii) the last oral submission on the request. The Working
Paper explains ‘[t]his time limit is intended to promote time and cost efficiency with
respect to a request for security for costs without compromising the Tribunal’s ability to

fully consider the parties’ submissions in reaching its decision’.

(d) Content of the tribunal's decision on the request
As noted above, Draft Rule 51 requires the tribunal to consider two broad criteria when

making its decision on the request for security for costs. These criteria are set out in
Draft Rule 51(3), which reads as follows:

In determining whether to order a party to provide security for costs, the Tribunal shall
consider the party’s ability to comply with an adverse decision on costs and any other
relevant circumstances.

While the Working Paper confirms that these broad criteria are mandatory (‘required’)
considerations for the Tribunal, it emphasises that the intent of Draft Rule 51(3) is ‘to
provide general guidelines for Tribunals without inhibiting the flexibility they will need
to address a vast range of factual circumstances’. According to the Working Paper,
Draft Rule 51 ‘avoids more specific mandatory criteria because: (i) the relevance of
certain criteria varies on a case-by-case basis; (ii) currently, there is insufficient case
experience with security for costs in investment arbitration to devise a comprehensive
list of mandatory criteria; and (iii) specific criteria could become outdated and

compromise the longevity of the provision’!

In addition to addressing the two broad criteria in Draft Rule 51(3), the tribunal’s
decision must also ‘determine the appropriate terms for provision of the security’.
This additional content requirement flows from two sources: the first source is master

provision, Draft Rule 51(1), which expressly refers to the terms of security as a

Chapter 25 PARTICULAR PROCEDURES

component of the request; the second source is Draft Rule 51(4), which deals with
the consequences of a party’s failure to comply with an order for security for costs (as
a matter of logic and fairness, a party cannot be held to have failed to comply with
an order unless the terms of the order are sufficiently precise). The use of the word
‘appropriate’ signals that the tribunal has significant discretion in deciding how security
should be provided and on what terms.

(e) Consequences of non-compliance with orders for security for costs

Draft Rule 51(4) sets out the regime that applies in circumstances where an order for
security for costs is not complied with by the party against whom it is made. Draft Rule
51(4) provides that the tribunal may suspend the proceeding until the ordered security
is provided and, if the proceeding is suspended for more than 90 days, the tribunal
may, after consulting with the parties, order the discontinuance of the proceeding. It is
important to observe that Draft Rule 51(4) uses the permissive word ‘may’ (rather than
mandatory ‘shall’), thereby signalling that the tribunal retains discretion to determine
what consequences should follow from non-compliance with its security for costs order.
Based on Rule 39 jurisprudence, it is reasonable to expect that access to justice would be
a major factor in the tribunal’s exercise of the discretion given to it by Draft Rule 51(4)
(i.e. would it be justified in the circumstances to foreclose the non-compliant party’s
right to have its dispute resolved by ICSID arbitration?).

While to an extent the suspension mechanism in Draft Rule 51(4) has a precedent in
the RSM v. St Lucia case,'™ and an equivalent provision is present in the Arbitration
Rules of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce, many users of the ICSID system will
still see it as a radical proposal. As the Working Paper notes, Draft Rule 51(4) ‘would be
unique within the [Rules], which otherwise give the Tribunal the power to discontinue
the proceedings only with the (deemed) agreement or acquiescence of the parties’."?
However, as the Working Paper also notes, ‘many of the tools normally employed by
Tribunals to address non-compliance with an order may be ineffective’* for security for
costs orders, and at least two Free Trade Agreements have recently included provisions
that allow a tribunal to suspend or dismiss the case if a claimant fails to comply with an
order for security for costs.’ It remains to be seen whether Member States will support
the adoption of Draft Rule 51(4) in the form proposed by ICSID.

RULE 40 —- ANCILLARY CLAIMS

(f) Change in circumstances and modification/revocation of order for security for
costs

Draft Rule 51(5) requires that ‘[a] party must promptly disclose any material change
in the circumstances upon which the Tribunal ordered security for costs’. The Working
Paper explains that this disclosure obligation is intended to complement Draft Rule
51(6), which gives the tribunal the power to modify or revoke its order for security for

costs.

The text of Draft Rule 51(5) sets three conditions that must be met before the obligation
to disclose is triggered. First, the tribunal must have ordered security for costs (if the
tribunal decided nof to order security, no disclosure obligation arises under Draft rule
51(5)). Second, there must be a change in the ‘circumstances upon which the Tribunal
ordered security’. These circumstances should be set out in the reasons given for the
tribunal’s order — if what has changed is not part of the circumstances recorded in
the order, no disclosure need be given. Third, the change in circumstances must be
‘material’, meaning it makes a significant or important difference to the facts that the

tribunal relied upon to make its order for security for costs.

Ifa party discloses a change in circumstances under Draft Rule 51(5), it is open to the
tribunal to modify or revoke its order accordingly, whether the parties request it to do
so or not. The Working Paper explains that this power is given to the tribunal to ‘ensure
the effectiveness of its order or take account of a change in the circumstances on which

the order was based’.1"

1. INTRODUCTION

The commentary below introduces Rule 40 and sets out the requirements which must
be met in order to submit ancillary claims. The commentary concludes by considering
the proposed amendments by the ICSID Secretariat to Rule 40.

Rule 40 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules sets out the framework that enables parties
to submit claims that are ancillary to the main claims being arbitrated. The main
purpose of this provision is to foster judicial efficiency by eliminating the need for
multiple proceedings to be brought by the same parties on different aspects of the same
dispute.'”? Furthermore, this provision helps avoid inconsistent awards, as it allows for
a single panel to decide on all related claims.’”’ Rule 40 supplements Article 46 of the
ICSID Convention, which provides:

Except as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal shall, if requested by a party,
determine any incidental or additional claims or counterclaims arising directly out of
the subject-matter of the dispute provided that they are within the scope of the consent
of the parties and are otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Centre.

Rule 40 covers three types of ancillary claims, namely (i) incidental claims, (ii) additional
claims and (iii) counter-claims. An incidental claim is generally understood as one
arising as a consequence of the original claim. Examples of incidental claims thus
include claims for pre- or post-award interest, and claims for costs. By contrast, an
additional claim is normally presented as a new claim that supplements the original
claims (thereby amending the body of claims originally formulated by the claimant).
On the other hand, a counter-claim enables a respondent State to present a claim against

the investor, which arises directly out of the subject-matter of the primary claim.'”

While incidental and additional claims cover slightly different realities, the differences

between the two categories of ancillary claims are largely a matter of semantics. In

practice, they are governed by the same regime, and ICSID Tribunals have made it clear

that it is ‘not necessary to distinguish between “incidental” and “additional” claims’.!”°

Counterclaims have not been very common in ICSID practice and have primarily been
raised in cases arising under investment contracts.“ This is because under investment
treaties, most Tribunals have found such counterclaims to be beyond their jurisdiction

because counterclaims were not foreseen by the relevant treaty.'”

This is not to say,
however, that treaty-based counterclaims have always been rejected on jurisdictional
grounds.’° Counterclaims filed under a treaty might be expected to become more
common in the future, as new generations of investment treaties now expressly provide
for reciprocal obligations of investors and States and for the possibility for respondent

States to file counterclaims against investors.'””

2. COMMENTARY ON RULE 40
A. Except as the parties otherwise agree

The first part of Rule 40(1) underscores the fact that the admissibility of ancillary claims
is subject to variation or exclusion by the parties. In order to present an ancillary claim,
the applicant must be able to confirm that the parties (i.e. the parties to the dispute,
not to the underlying consent instrument) have not excluded by agreement the right
to present ancillary claims before a tribunal. Authors are not aware of any cases where
such a right was waived by agreement of the parties. While it would appear self-evident,
some commentators have noted that this wording also affirms that the tribunal, of its

own volition, may not initiate ancillary claims on behalf of the parties.'”*

An ancillary claim, if properly filed, forms part of the claims to be resolved by the
tribunal. The provisions of Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention, which provides
that ‘the award shall deal with every question submitted to the tribunal’, apply to such

ancillary claims just like they apply to any initial claim and counterclaim. Article 48(3)

entails that if the tribunal does not engage with an ancillary claim submitted by a party,

it opens its award to annulment proceedings.'”
B. Arising directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute

The second requirement for an ancillary claim to be admissible under Rule 40 is one
of connexity with the subject-matter of the dispute. The party wishing to submit an
ancillary claim must demonstrate that such ancillary claim has sufficient connection
with the primary claim. This requirement is unsurprising. It simply reflects the rationale
of Rule 40 mentioned above: to foster judicial efficiency by avoiding the need for
multiple proceedings. In many cases, the close connection requirement is so obvious
that it does not give rise to any discussion by tribunals.'*° This will be the case typically

in respect of claims for legal costs or interest.'*!

(a) Factual connexity

It is generally agreed that ancillary claims must be factually connected to the primary
claim to be admissible.’ According to an early explanatory note which was published
with the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the test to satisfy this requirement is ‘whether the
factual connection between the original and the ancillary claim is so close as to require
the adjudication of the latter in order to achieve the final settlement of the dispute’

).°° Rule 40 and Convention Article 46, however, do not prescribe

(emphasis added
how ‘intense’ the factual connection between the primary claim and the ancillary
claim must be. This suggests a high level of connection. Such approach was taken in
Itera v. Georgia, where the majority of tribunal held that ‘the link between the claims
must be so strong that the examination of one claim cannot be carried out adequately
without the other claim being adjudicated at the same time’.'** It assumes that the test
is whether or not the overall dispute can be properly disposed of without determining
the ancillary claim alongside the primary claim. Some other ICSID tribunals seem to
have taken a more liberal approach. For instance, in LG&E v. Argentina, the Tribunal
was content to accept additional claims of the claimant because the facts relied upon in

‘by the Claimants in the “Additional Request” [were] sequential to those alleged by the

Claimants in their original Request’, so that, as claimed by the claimant, they formed

‘aspects of a single, continuous dispute’.

We might argue that factors which should militate in favour of a finding of factual
connexity include inter alia, the presence of (i) some identical facts as those relied upon
in support of the primary claim, and (ii) facts that are distinct from those of the primary
claim, but which involve the same participants, or occurred during the same period of
time or in the same location as the primary claim. Interestingly ancillary claims could
arise out of facts which occurred after the filing of the Request for Arbitration.’*° In
essence, the more ‘connective tissue’ there is between the facts of the primary claim and
those of the ancillary claim, the more likely a tribunal should be to find that the factual

connexity requirement is met.

(b) Legal connexity

Some commentators’*’ and some tribunals appear to have taken the view that, for an
ancillary claim to be admissible, there should also be /ega/connexity between the primary
and ancillary claims. In K/ockner v. Cameroon, the tribunal held that the primary claim
and the counterclaim must be ‘indivisible’ and ‘interdependent’.¥* The UNCITRAL
Tribunal in Sa/uka took this to imply a legal connexity requirement in assessing the
connection between a counterclaim and the original claim, and found it could not hear
a counterclaim because such counterclaim ‘in principle [had] to be decided through
the appropriate procedures of Czech law and not through the particular investment
protection procedures of the Treaty’.'”

This in turn implies an assessment of the juridical connection between the primary
and ancillary claims, in addition to the assessment of factual connexity."”° It is unclear,
however, whether the text of Rule 40 imposes both factual and legal connexity
requirements so that these two requirements need to be met cumulatively." Indeed,

the approach adopted by the tribunal in Sa/uka has been widely criticized.” Arguably,

Chapter 25 PARTICULAR PROCEDURES

a better interpretation of Rule 40 is that it is broad enough to leave to tribunals the
discretion to decide what constitutes sufficient connexity in a particular case, looking at

both legal and factual aspects.

(1) Recent awards rendered by ICSID tribunals suggest that tribunals are adopting a
broader interpretation of the connexity requirement. The tribunal in Urbaser et al. v.
The Argentine Republic considered that it would be sufficient to accept jurisdiction
over the counterclaim where the ‘factual connection’ between the claimant’s claim
and the respondent’s counterclaim ‘is manifest’.!* It found that ‘both the principal
claim and the claim opposed to it are based on the same investment, or the alleged
lack of sufficient investment, in relation to the same Concession’.

(2) A similar approach was adopted by the tribunal in Burlington Resources Inc. v.
Republic of Ecuador.» Unusually, the claimant did not raise any jurisdictional
objections to the respondent’s counterclaim, as the parties agreed from the outset
that they would commit to the jurisdiction of the tribunal over counterclaims.
However, the tribunal still assessed Ecuador’s counterclaims within the scope
of Rule 40. The tribunal determined that there was sufficient factual connexity
between the primary claim and counterclaim, and concluded that the counterclaims
related to the same investments which are the issue of the primary claim. The
tribunal did not address the legal connexity between the primary claim and the

counterclaim.
C. Within the scope of the consent of the parties

Rule 40 provides that, for an ancillary claim to be admissible, it needs to fall within the
scope of the parties’ consent. This requirement merely mirrors that already contained
in Convention Article 46. Neither Rule 40, nor Convention Article 46 set out how
consent should be demonstrated. Consent, in this context, will often but not always
be contained within the same provision of the treaty, contract or statute underlying
the primary claim. The tribunal will have to scrutinize the language of the provision
and determine whether it permits the submission of ancillary claims, and, specifically,

counterclaims.

An analysis of some of the key decisions demonstrates a pattern in how tribunals interpret
the dispute resolution clauses within investment treaties in determining whether or

not to accept jurisdiction over counterclaims. Tribunals have often interpreted broadly

drafted provisions that refer to, for example, ‘all/any disputes’ or just ‘disputes’ so to
encompass counterclaims. Whilst not ICSID cases, the tribunals’ decisions in Saluka v.
Czech Republic” and Paushok v. Mongolia’ provide a useful illustration in that respect,

and one which has been widely referenced by ICISD tribunals.

Saluka concerned a dispute that arose out of the Netherlands-Czech and Slovak
Republic BIT. Article 8(1) of the BIT covered ‘all disputes between one Contracting
Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party concerning an investment of the
latter’. The tribunal in this case found that Article 8 of the BIT was ‘wide enough
to include disputes giving rise to counterclaims, so long, of course, as other relevant

requirements are also met’.'”

In Paushok, the tribunal, whilst referring to the Sa/uka decision, concluded that the
dispute resolution provision contained in Article 6 of the Russia~-Mongolia BIT, which
covered ‘disputes between one of the Contracting Parties and an investor of the other
Contracting Party, arising in connection with realization of investments’ was similar
enough to Article 8 of the Netherlands-Czech and Slovak Republic BIT, and that
‘there is no reason to make a difference between the two’. This is despite the fact that

one refers to ‘all disputes’ and the other refers to ‘disputes’.

This approach was adopted by the tribunal in Metal-Tech v. Uzbekistan.’”' Here, the
dispute resolution provision contained in the Israel-Uzbekistan BIT referred to ‘any
legal dispute arising between that Contracting Party and a national or company of the
other Contracting Party concerning an investment of the latter in the territory of the
former’. The tribunal in this case interpreted this provision so as to encompass ‘any
dispute about an investment’, explaining that it ‘is not restricted to disputes initiated
by an investor against a Contracting Party’.° These cases highlight the willingness
of tribunals to accept jurisdiction over counterclaims, where the underlying treaty is

drafted broadly.

On the other hand, other tribunals have taken a more restrictive approach in respect

of investment treaties which are drafted in narrower terms. In Roussalis v. Romania,'4

a dispute arose under the Greece-Romania 1997 BIT. Romania submitted a
counterclaim, which the claimant contested on a number of grounds including, in
particular that it never consented to the counterclaim, and that the wording of the
dispute resolution provision contained within the BIT did not permit counterclaims.
The majority of the tribunal found that the counterclaim fell outside the parties’
consent because of the specific wording of the BIT. Article 9(1) of the BIT provided
that an investor might submit a dispute to ICSID, but limited the scope of eligible
disputes to those ‘concerning an obligation of [the Host State] under this Agreement,
in relation to an investment of [the investor]’. The majority interpreted this language
as limiting the tribunal’s jurisdiction to claims submitted by the investor against the
host State in respect of treaty violations committed by the host State,’° and that this
particular wording excluded the possibility that the parties could have consented to
have counterclaims arbitrated. Furthermore, the majority found that the wording of
the BIT imposed substantive obligations only on the two Contracting States, and not

the investors. Similar conclusions were reached in Rusoro v. Venezuela’®

157

and Vestey v.
Venezuela'”’ where tribunals were tasked to interpret similarly worded dispute resolution

provisions.’*

The tribunal in Gavazzi v. Romania adopted an even stricter approach in assessing
the issue of consent. The dispute concerned the privatization of a steel company by
the Romanian Government, in which Romania filed a counterclaim on grounds that
the claimant failed to comply with contractual obligations between the parties, as well
as provisions of Romanian law.’ The majority of the tribunal rejected jurisdiction
over the counterclaim on the basis of the following grounds. First, a lack of explicit
reference to counterclaims in the Italy-Romania BIT. This is an unusual departure
from the consistent case law, which did not consider this omission to translate into
rejecting jurisdiction over a counterclaim. Second, the majority found that the reference

to the investors’ right to initiate a claim in Article 8(2) barred the State from filing

158 In Roussalis, however, Professor Reisman issued a dissenting opinion. Essentially, for Professor Reisman the investor's
consent to ICSID (or rather his acceptance of the State’s open offer to arbitrate) was sufficient to imply a consent to
counterclaims, and there was no need to identify additional consent in the underlying BIT. This approach made sense
from a policy perspective. The decision of the majority to reject the counterclaim indeed meant that the respondent was
effectively directed ‘to pursue its claims in its own courts where the very investor who had sought a forum outside the
state apparatus is now constrained to become the defendant’. Professor Reisman’s opinion, however, renders the words
‘within the scope of consent’ in Rule 40 and Convention Article 46 superfluous.

counterclaims. This is despite the fact the Article 8(1) of the BIT encompassed a range
of arbitrable disputes.

However, the decision of the tribunal in Urdaser v. The Argentine Republic,“ marked
a shift away from the rigid approach adopted by the majority tribunal in Gavazzi
v. Romania. Here, the tribunal rejected the claimants’ assertion that granting the
respondent a right to counterclaim ‘would run counter to the object and purpose of
treaty arbitration, which is to grant the investors a one-sided right of quasi-judicial
review of national regulatory action’.'*' The tribunal did so by reference to Article 10(1)
of the BIT, which it determined was wide enough to encompass counterclaims, and
which provided: ‘disputes arising between a Party and an investor of the other Party
in connection with investments within the meaning of this Agreement shall, as far
as possible, be settled amicably between the parties to the dispute’."” The tribunal
went as far as suggesting that the wording of the provision would permit the State to
commence proceedings against the investor on its own initiative.’ Whilst the tribunal
did accept jurisdiction over Argentina’s counterclaim, it did eventually dismiss the
counterclaim on the merits.'™ Therefore, while the approach adopted by the tribunal in
Urbaser is a positive development, it does not entirely resolve the issue of uncertainty in

determining jurisdiction over counterclaims.’®
D. Otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Centre

This requirement in Rule 40 is borne out of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention,
which states that: ‘the jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising

directly out of an investment’.

It is distinct from, and in addition to, the requirement to show that the ancillary claim
arises directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute, even though the reasoning of the
two often overlaps. Provided that the main claim satisfies the jurisdictional test set out
in Article 25, ancillary claims which arise out of the same subject-matter of the main

claim should in principle fall within the scope of Article 25 of the Convention.

E. Proposed amendments to Rule 40

The ICSID Secretariat launched an extensive review to update its rules in October
2016, against the backdrop of widespread challenges to the legitimacy of investor-
State arbitration. This is the fourth rule amendments process embarked on by the
ICSID Secretariat, and it aims to modernize its arbitration process by updating its
rules, specifically focusing on transparency, early disclosure of third-party funding,
time limits, electronic filing, and arbitrator appointment and challenges. The ICSID
Secretariat expects to adopt the revised rules in 2019 or 2020.

In August 2018, the ICSID Secretariat published draft proposals for amendment of its

rules, 12 years after its last major update. The proposed amendment of Rule 40 provides:

Rule 52

(1) Unless the parties agree otherwise, a party may file an incidental or additional
claim or a counter-claim (‘ancillary claim’) arising directly out of the subject-
matter of the dispute, provided that such ancillary claim is within the scope of the
consent of the parties and the jurisdiction of the Centre.

(2) An incidental or additional claim shall be presented no later than the date to file
the reply, and a counter-claim shall be presented no later than the date to file the
counter-memorial, unless the Tribunal decides otherwise.

The proposed revision to Rule 40 is far from being drastic, and this is in part due to the
fact that it mirrors Article 46 of the ICSID Convention. Whilst the Working Party
did not propose any amendments to Rule 40(1), it did propose amending 40(2) which
deals with time limits for filing ancillary claims, so that it ‘anchors the time limit to the
date originally scheduled for the filing of the counter-memorial and reply as opposed to
the date these pleadings are actually filed’. This change is principally made to increase

efficiency as well as limit abuse.’

The Working Paper notes that very few comments were received in respect of amending
Rule 40,'*’ stating that counterclaims were rare in practice. It further noted that in
cases where arbitration has been commenced under an investment treaty, tribunals
often found that they did not have jurisdiction over the claim, due to the drafting of
the dispute resolution provision within the treaty.’ It does, however, acknowledge that

counter-claims are becoming increasingly relevant, specifically following awards such

as Burlington v. Ecuador, where the dispute resolution provision in the treaty provides

for reciprocal obligations for the investor and the State.’”

Only one Member State commented that amendment to Rule 40 should address
the inequality between the parties in respect of counterclaims.'” This is surprising
considering the low success rate of counterclaims in general. However, this may be
an acknowledgement that the institutional rules can only go so far so as to enable
tribunals to accept jurisdiction over counterclaims in treaty-based arbitrations, and it
will ultimately require revisions of the BITs, in which the consent to arbitration, and

therefore counterclaims is found.

Undoubtedly, there is a need to develop some certainty in the context of jurisdiction
over counterclaims. Whilst the asymmetry of investment treaties in favour of
the investor is acknowledged,’ it is important to fend off criticism targeted at the
investor-State arbitration system, in order to enhance the legitimacy of the process.'”
One approach to this may involve removing the consent requirement as part of the
jurisdictional assessment, and this is the approach which SIAC adopted in its latest
investment arbitration rules, whereby counterclaims are explicitly contemplated, and

are not subject to the parties’ consent.'”

claim, for the filing of the rejoinder — unless the facts on which the objection is
based are unknown to the party at that time.

The Tribunal may on its own initiative consider, at any stage of the proceeding,
whether the dispute or any ancillary claim before it is within the jurisdiction of
the Centre and within its own competence.

Upon the formal raising of an objection relating to the dispute, the Tribunal may
decide to suspend the proceeding on the merits. The President of the Tribunal,
after consultation with its other members, shall fix a time limit within which the
parties may file observations on the objection.

The Tribunal shall decide whether or not the further procedures relating to the
objection made pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be oral. It may deal with the
objection as a preliminary question or join it to the merits of the dispute. If the
Tribunal overrules the objection or joins it to the merits, it shall once more fix
time limits for the further procedures.

Unless the parties have agreed to another expedited procedure for making
preliminary objections, a party may, no later than 30 days after the constitution
of the Tribunal, and in any event before the first session of the Tribunal, file an
objection that a claim is manifestly without legal merit. The party shall specify
as precisely as possible the basis for the objection. The Tribunal, after giving the
parties the opportunity to present their observations on the objection, shall, at
its first session or promptly thereafter, notify the parties of its decision on the
objection. The decision of the Tribunal shall be without prejudice to the right of
a party to file an objection pursuant to paragraph (1) or to object, in the course of
the proceeding, that a claim lacks legal merit.

If the Tribunal decides that the dispute is not within the jurisdiction of the
Centre or not within its own competence, or that all claims are manifestly
without legal merit, it shall render an award to that effect.

1. COMMENTARY

A. Timing of preliminary objections (Rule 41(1))

Rule 41(1) sets out the basic timing requirements for making objections to the

jurisdiction of ICSID or to the competence of the tribunal. These requirements apply

to objections arising both from the ICSID Convention and the specific instrument

containing consent to ICSID arbitration, most often an international investment

agreement. Ihe Rule uses the term ‘jurisdiction’ to refer specifically to the jurisdiction

of ICSID, while it uses the term ‘competence’ to include issues that might, in other

contexts, also be called jurisdictional.

RULE 41 — PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS

Although a distinction can be drawn between jurisdiction and admissibility,'”
tribunals have often interpreted Rule 41 to cover admissibility objections in addition
to straightforwardly jurisdictional objections. For example, the Rompetrol v. Romania
tribunal considered that, if Rule 41(1) is interpreted with a realistic ‘degree of flexibility’,
it could encompass admissibility objections as objections to the competence of the
tribunal.'” For the sake of convenience, all such objections might be referred to as
‘preliminary objections’, keeping in mind that some tribunals might elect to distinguish

between different categories of preliminary objections.

(a) Timing requirements for preliminary objections

Rule 41(1) specifies two principal timing requirements. It provides that a preliminary
objection must be made as early as possible, and, in any event, no later than the counter-
memorial or, if it relates to an ancillary claim, the rejoinder. Although limited tribunals
have addressed this Rule, those tribunals largely consider preliminary objections to be
timely so long as they are made by the counter-memorial or, when there is a specific
procedural calendar for preliminary objections, in accordance with its requirements.
However, when the facts underlying the objection were unknown when preliminary

objections were otherwise due, the objection may be made later.'”°

(i) As early as possible requirement

Rule 41(1) specifies as its primary requirement that all preliminary objections must be
made as early as possible. This requirement implies that the objecting party must raise
an objection as soon as it discovers the basis for the objection.'”” However, tribunals
have mostly considered that objections are made ‘as early as possible’ so long as they
satisfy both the specific procedural schedule for the arbitration, when relevant, and the

requirement that objections be made no later than in the counter-memorial (discussed

below).

Chapter 25 PARTICULAR PROCEDURES

For example, according to the Arif'v. Moldova tribunal, an objection is timely when filed
with the counter-memorial or when filed in accordance with the procedural calendar,
regardless of whether such filing is as early as possible.'”® The Arif v. Moldova tribunal
specifically rejected the view that it lacked the power pursuant to Rule 41 to amend the
timing for filing jurisdictional objections.’ The Urbaser v. Argentina tribunal similarly
concluded both that the Rule 41(1) requirement that objections must be filed no later
than the counter-memorial ‘overrides any possible sanction for failure to file ‘as early as

possible’ and that the procedural calendar establishes the ultimately applicable rules.'*°

However, this view has not been uniformly accepted. The Desert Line v. Yemen tribunal
did notably recognize the obligation to file an objection ‘as soon as possible’ regardless
of the counter-memorial requirement or the procedural calendar. It specifically
considered that ‘[t]he fact that objections shall be filed with ICSID “no later” than
the deadline for the Counter-Memorial does not mean that the Respondent was not
bound to raise them before that date’.'8' Nevertheless, despite emphasizing that an
objection could have been made when the investor ‘indicated its intention of pursuing
ICSID arbitration’, the tribunal placed no practical import on the procedural violation;

it ultimately considered the merits of the objection. 1%”

(ii) The counter-memorial and procedural calendar requirements

The Rule 41(1) requirement that preliminary objections must be filed no later than the
counter-memorial has been consistently applied. Absent an objection based on facts
unknown at the time of the counter-memorial, an objection submitted after the counter-
memorial is untimely.'®’ Those tribunals to consider the issue have typically applied
the counter-memorial cut-off as a bright-line rule to find objections untimely.'™ For
example, the Ampal American Israel v. Egypt tribunal denied an objection first made in

£185

a post-hearing brief’*? while the von Pezold v. Zimbabwe tribunal similarly considered

untimely an objection raised in the rejoinder.'*°

RULE 41 — PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS

However, where the tribunal has set a specific procedural calendar, objections not
raised in compliance with the calendar (and especially after a decision on preliminary
objections) may well be untimely even when made no later than in the counter-
memorial on the merits.'*’ In fact, the Autopista v. Venezuela tribunal directly stated
that an objection was ‘belated, because it was submitted well after the Decision on
Jurisdiction’.'** The practice of tribunals is largely consistent with the principle that the
particular procedural calendar in an arbitration determines when it is appropriate to
lodge objections.'®? In effect, the tribunal may consider that it can decide what ‘as early
as possible’ means, and set that date prior to the deadline for the counter-memorial.

For example, the Pac Rim v. E/ Salvador tribunal considered objections to be untimely
when they were raised after the preliminary objection phase but no later than the
counter-memorial on the merits.'?? Although El Salvador argued that its ‘objections
could not have been anticipated before the Claimant’s Memorial on the Merits’,!?!
the tribunal concluded that the counter-memorial deadline for objections ‘does not
negate the primary obligation to raise jurisdictional objections as early as possible’ and
that ‘[t]he imposition of this time limit is an additional condition, not an alternative

requirement’.!”

Similarly, the Siag v. Egypt tribunal concluded that preliminary objections were
untimely principally for failure to comply with the procedural calendar, even though

submitted before the counter-memorial. As that tribunal explained, ‘[t]he last date

187 Schreuer (n 176) 1086. Schreuer places particular emphasis on the decision on jurisdiction. However, while the decision
on jurisdiction itself will naturally be relevant to determining timeliness based on the procedural calendar, it is only one
element of that analysis. If the procedural calendar is taken to determine timeliness, a tribunal might insist that any
objection filed after the memorial on jurisdiction or the final submission on jurisdiction is untimely, even if prior to the
decision on jurisdiction.

Egypt’s application was made more than 13 months after that date, and was made more
than 5 months after the Tribunal had issued its Decision on Jurisdiction, dated 11 April
2007".'°

(iii) Timing for objections to ancillary claims
Rule 41(1) establishes parallel timing requirements for preliminary objections to
ancillary claims, requiring their submission ‘as early as possible’ and no later than

§ Although the timing for objections to ancillary claims has not been

extensively addressed (as there are relatively few cases of ancillary claims), the von
Pezold v. Zimbabwe tribunal confirmed that ‘jurisdictional challenges contained in the
Rejoinder, in so far as they relate to the Claimants’ ancillary claims pleaded with its

Reply, are timely raised’.!”°

An ancillary claim, according to Rule 40(1) is ‘an incidental or additional claim or
counter-claim arising directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute’.!”° This rule
permits the claimant to make incidental or additional claims as late as the reply and
permits the respondent to make counter-claims as late as the counter-memorial.'”’ The
timing requirement in Rule 41(1) thus requires in effect that the party opposing claims
submitted at the latest possible date makes its objections no later than at the time of its

next written submission.

(iv) Subsequently discovered facts
Rule 41(1) establishes an exception to its requirement that objections be filed no
later than the counter-memorial (and objections to ancillary claims no later than the

rejoinder) when a preliminary objection is based on subsequently discovered facts.

Although this exception has not been extensively invoked, tribunals have addressed
the exception to the timing requirements in several cases. For example, the Urbaser
v. Argentina tribunal decided to examine otherwise untimely new objections on the
grounds that they were based on newly discovered facts. As the tribunal explained,
‘Respondent contends that it did find support for parts of its objections in documents

only very recently made available, that triggers application of Arbitration Rule

procedural obstacles. See also paras 108, 136, 226, 305. Egypt submitted counter-memorial on merits on 12 October

41(1) in fine’.'°8 The Pac Rim v. El Salvador tribunal applied the rule similarly when
information first appeared in a memorial on the merits, after an earlier phase on
preliminary objections had been completed and after the tribunal had issued a decision

on preliminary objections.”

In fact, the Tokios Tokelés v. Ukraine tribunal recognized that the exception for new facts
applied even when the subsequently discovered facts concerned a specific jurisdictional
objection that had already been decided. One factor motivating the tribunal to reopen
the jurisdictional objection was the tribunal’s conclusion that the information had
wrongly not been disclosed previously. According to the tribunal: ‘Justice required that

the issue of jurisdiction should be reassessed in the light of this new information .. .””°°

Objections based on newly discovered facts remain subject to the ‘as early as possible’
requirement. In Vestey Group v. Venezuela, Venezuela argued ‘that it learned of
Vestey’s abandonment of its original claims through the Rejoinder on Jurisdiction’.””!
Nevertheless, the tribunal sharply rebuked Venezuela for failing to raise its objection
quickly following the discovery of those facts and rejected the objection as untimely.
The tribunal observed that Venezuela ‘waited until the first day of the hearing .. . to
raise its defense’ and concluded that ‘[a] time lag of eight months does obviously not

meet the “as early as possible” requirement’?

(b) Consequences of untimely objections

The potential consequence for making an untimely objection is the loss of the right to
object. However, whether a tribunal will apply this sanction is context-dependent.*™
The interest in promoting procedural regularity and economy may conflict with the
interest in ensuring that the tribunal has proper jurisdiction and competence. This
conflict has led some tribunals to evaluate preliminary objections even when untimely
and other tribunals to reject the objections out of hand (while also observing, often, that

the objection has no merit).?"

Although some tribunals that rejected an objection for untimeliness have not specified
the ICSID Arbitration Rule on which the rejection was based,”” several tribunals have

considered the issue based on Rule 26(3), which provides that untimely actions shall be

ignored, or based on Rule 27, which provides that procedural objections are waived if not
made promptly.7°° Nevertheless, many tribunals have considered untimely objections,
regardless of these rules, based on their Rule 41(2) power to consider jurisdictional and

competence issues sua sponte (see below).

(i) Disregard (pursuant to Rule 26(3))

Rule 26(3)*°’ provides one possible basis for rejecting objections not made in
conformity with applicable time limits. It instructs tribunals to ignore actions taken
after the deadline has expired. As it establishes, ‘[a]ny step taken after expiration of the
applicable time limit shall be disregarded unless the Tribunal, in special circumstances

and after giving the other party an opportunity of stating its views, decides otherwise’.

Several tribunals have approached the question of the procedural consequences for
untimely preliminary objections through the lens of Rule 26(3). The Siag v. Egypt
tribunal rejected belated objections on the basis of this Rule (as well as Rule 27),?”
while the von Pezold v. Zimbabwe ultimately ruled belated objections admissible on the

basis of the same Rule.?”

If the consequences of a late objection depend on Rule 26(3), an untimely objection
may nevertheless be heard if there are relevant special circumstances. The von
Pezold v. Zimbabwe tribunal, for example, took into account a number of factors
that, ‘cumulatively, constitute special circumstances’ when it admitted the untimely
jurisdictional objections.7"° Among the factors it considered relevant were the late
retention of external counsel, timing of ancillary claims, interconnected objections to

ancillary and primary claims, and concern about enforceability of the award.*"

(ii) Waiver (pursuant to Rule 27)

Rule 27°” provides a second basis for rejecting an untimely objection on the grounds
that it has been waived. Rule 27 states that, ‘[a] party which knows or should have
known that a provision ...of any other rules or agreement applicable to the proceeding,
or of an order of the Tribunal has not been complied with and which fails to state
promptly its objections thereto, shall be deemed ... to have waived its right to object’.

206 ‘This requirement is distinct from the timing requirements applicable to preliminary objections and specified in Rule
41(1) (see commentary to Rule 41 in this book, para 25.136).

RULE 41 — PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS

As with Rule 26(3), a number of tribunals have elected to consider the effects of an
untimely objection on the basis of Rule 27. For example, the Siag v. Egypt tribunal
rejected late objections on this basis (as well as Rule 26(3)),7'° while the He/nan v.
Egypt and the Gruslin v. Malaysia tribunals each found the objections admissible
despite the waiver provision.*’* To reach this result, the He/nan v. Egypt tribunal, for
example, concluded that ‘EGYPT is apparently convinced that is was only within the
merits phase of the proceedings that its right to provide the necessary evidence in this

respect could be exercised, as explained by its counsel at the Hearing’.??

B. Evaluation of preliminary objections sua sponte (Rule 41(2))

Rule 41(2) provides that tribunals have the power to consider objections to jurisdiction
and competence at their own initiative at any point during the arbitral proceedings.
This authority is designed to avoid awards that exceed the tribunal’s authority if the
parties fail to make preliminary objections or make them at the appropriate time.?"°
The failure of the tribunal to examine preliminary objections has the potential to result

in annulment of the award.?!”

(a) Unaddressed objections

The core purpose of Rule 41(2) is to permit a tribunal to raise a preliminary objection
not otherwise submitted by the parties. Although there is no reason to doubt that a
tribunal may apply the rule to this end, this use has not been frequent. However, the
Hamester v. Ghana tribunal did elect to consider sua sponte a jurisdictional objection not
submitted by cither party to the dispute.?'® That tribunal itself raised and ultimately
rejected the objection that its jurisdiction would be affected by the fact that the claimant

transferred shares in the investment after submitting the dispute.?””

(b) Reformulation of objections

More common is the use of Rule 41(2) to restate or reformulate objections that the
parties have themselves submitted. For example, both the Caratube v. Kazakhstan and
the Aguas del Tunari v. Bolivia tribunals considered that the rule conveys ‘the power to

consider ways in which an ambiguous or unclear objection may bear on jurisdiction

and to restate such objections, as appropriate, so as to allow a full examination of
jurisdiction’.””° The Ickale Insaat v. Turkmenistan tribunal similarly invoked this power
and noted that a tribunal ‘must have the authority to take a decision that it deems
correct, so long as it has given the Parties an opportunity to argue the issue it has
raised’.**1

(c) Untimely objections

Perhaps the most prevalent, albeit occasional, use of Rule 41(2) is to consider preliminary
objections that the parties submitted in an untimely fashion. Thus, even if a party does
not make a timely submission of its objection, the tribunal may nevertheless have the

power to consider the objection sua sponte.

For example, the Pac Rim v. El Salvador tribunal concluded that a tribunal has ‘the
power to examine, upon its own initiative at any time, any jurisdictional question it
considers pertinent, even if it entails a matter that was raised belatedly by a party or
not raised by any party at all’? Although that tribunal had explicitly found several
preliminary objections submitted after its decision on jurisdiction to be untimely,
it nevertheless went on to evaluate them on the basis of its Rule 41(2) power.” It
followed a number of other tribunals that have either applied?” or indicated support

for this approach to belated preliminary objections.””°

Providing further explanation for this approach, the AIG v. Kazakhstan tribunal
explained, without direct reference to Rule 41(2), that time limits ‘could not...
empower the Arbitral Tribunal to grant relief to a Claimant when there is apparently no
jurisdiction of the Centre or the Tribunal to entertain and try the case’.?”° The tribunal
interpreted the rules on time limits as, instead, ‘intended to alert the parties to bring
forth their objections, basic to the dispute being adjudicated upon on merits, at the
earliest possible point of time’.’”” The later Daimler v. Argentina tribunal more directly

connected such considerations to Rule 41(2).?78

RULE 41 — PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS

However, at least one tribunal, Vestey v. Venezuela, rejected this approach and prioritized
the need to enforce time limits over the tribunal’s power to review objections ex officio.*”
In its words, ‘[t]he Tribunal’s discretionary power to review its jurisdiction ex officio does
not absolve the parties from compliance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1)’.7°° It
emphasized that the objection at issue was inadmissible because untimely.?>' However,
the circumstances of the case were somewhat unusual: Venezuela knew of the new
facts for eight months before raising the associated objection for the first time at the

hearing.**
C. Suspension of proceeding while considering preliminary objections (Rule 41(3))

Rule 41(3) permits a tribunal to suspend the proceedings on the merits while resolving
preliminary objections. If the proceedings on merits are suspended, an interim procedure

addressing the preliminary objections follows.”*°

This rule is not of automatic application whenever a preliminary objection is raised but
instead grants the tribunal the discretion to suspend proceedings. In fact, even when
the rule previously was phrased in mandatory language,”* tribunals still regularly
concluded that suspension of the proceedings was not automatic.”*° The Siag v. Egypt
tribunal observed that, with automatic suspension, ‘[a] party’s episodic and sequential
manufacturing of new jurisdictional arguments could eventually destroy the right of an

individual Claimant to its “day in Court”.”*°

In particular, tribunals have been reluctant to suspend proceedings when contrary to
procedural fairness.’°” One circumstance in which tribunals have declined immediate
suspension is when a new preliminary objection is raised after a decision on previous
preliminary objections has been issued.”** Suspension at this point would effectively
give rise to a second preliminary objections phase. A tribunal also might (but not

necessarily) decline immediate suspension when the objection is lodged before a full

memorial on the merits has been submitted.**’ Suspension before the memorial might,
depending on the nature of the objection, deprive the tribunal of sufficient information

about the substantive complaints to reach a decision.?”°

D. Tribunal authority to determine procedure for preliminary objections (Rule
41(4))

Rule 41(4) establishes three powers of a tribunal when resolving preliminary objections
submitted pursuant to Rule 41(1): the tribunal may determine whether or not to have
an oral procedure, the tribunal may determine whether to resolve an objection as a
preliminary question or to join it to the merits, and the tribunal may fix additional time

limits for further procedures after addressing the objections.

(a) Oral procedure

Rule 41(4) provides that a tribunal may decide whether or not to have oral proceedings
when evaluating preliminary objections. Tribunals have not extensively interpreted this
provision. However, it is fair to say that having oral argument in a preliminary objection

phase is common practice in ICSID arbitration.

(b) Joinder

Rule 41(4) provides that a tribunal may elect to have a separate preliminary objection
phase of the arbitration before proceeding to consideration of the merits.**! In the
alternative, the tribunal may also elect to consider any preliminary objections at the
same time as the merits, in a single procedure. In this case, the tribunal may immediately

join the preliminary objections to the merits, per the rule.

Generally speaking, tribunals have been strongly inclined toward joinder when the
preliminary objection is tightly connected to the merits or otherwise cannot be evaluated
on a preliminary basis. For example, the Alemanni v. Argentina tribunal discovered that
the objection was ‘so closely entwined with the substantive disagreement between the

Parties, both factual and legal, that it has to be joined to the merits’.

RULE 41 — PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS

Similarly, a prima facie objection (that the claim would fail legally even if the facts are
proved) may well be so closely connected to the merits that a tribunal would join it to
the merits. The Impregilo v. Pakistan tribunal took the view that ‘[o]nly after a careful
examination of those alleged breaches will the Tribunal be able to determine whether
the behaviour of Pakistan went beyond that which an ordinary Contracting party could
have adopted, and constituted “unfair and inequitable treatment” or “unjustified or
discriminatory measures” as contemplated in the BIT’. By contrast, the Bayindir
v. Pakistan tribunal rejected a prima facie objection and denied that its decision was
equivalent to joining it to the merits, as the applicable standards are distinct.7“

In fact, tribunals have understood Rule 41(4) to permit joinder to the merits even
following a separate preliminary objection phase (along with its concluding decision).*”
However, in the words of the E/ Paso v. Argentina tribunal, there must be a ‘cogent

reason for such a joinder’.7*

(c) Procedural timetable

Rule 41(4) grants the tribunal the procedural power to set a new procedural timetable at
the end of a preliminary objections phase or if it joins the preliminary objections to the
merits. Although tribunals widely cite Rule 41(4) to justify such procedural decisions,**”
the provision has not provoked much in the way of debate or interpretation. It is a
straightforward, common-sense provision that allows the tribunal to establish a new
timetable for the case in light of its procedural or substantive rulings on the preliminary

objections.

Chapter 25 PARTICULAR PROCEDURES

E. Expedited procedure for objection that a claim is manifestly without legal merit
(Rule 41(5))

Rule 41(5) provides for an expedited procedure for evaluating the specific preliminary
objection that the claim manifestly lacks legal merit. It stands apart from the previously
discussed provisions of Rule 41, which largely relate to the resolution of ordinary
preliminary objections to jurisdiction, competence, and admissibility. Introduced with
the 2006 amendments to the ICSID Arbitration Rules (the other clauses of Rule 41
date back to the original 1968 Rules), Rule 41(5) provides for a separate procedure
specifically designed for an expeditious disposition of ‘a claim that is so obviously

defective from a legal point of view that it can properly be dismissed outright’.*“°

(a) Meaning of ‘manifestly without legal merit’

Rule 41(5) specifies that a party may file an objection that a claim is ‘manifestly without
legal merit’. Tribunals have generally understood this provision to establish the standard
that any such objection must meet. This standard has given rise to questions about when
the lack of legal merit is manifest, whether the lack of legal merit can extend to factual
issues, and whether the lack of legal merit encompasses both jurisdictional and merits

issues.

(i) Manifest

According to Rule 41(5), the lack of legal merit must be manifest if the objection
is to succeed. The Trans-Global v. Jordan tribunal provided the widely accepted
interpretation of this provision.*”’ As it explained, ‘the ordinary meaning of the word
requires the respondent to establish its objection clearly and obviously, with relative
ease and despatch’ and ‘[t]he standard is thus set high’.?°° Applying this standard, both
the Brandes v. Venezuela tribunal and the MOL v. Croatia tribunal observed that ‘[t|he

The Trans-Global v. Jordan tribunal said that ‘[t]he exercise may thus be complicated;
but it should never be difficult’.?°? The MOL v. Croatia tribunal emphasized that ‘the
distinction has to be maintained between a claim by an investor that can properly be
rejected out of hand, and one which requires more elaborate argument for its eventual
disposition’.?°> And the Lion v. Mexico tribunal added that the standard does not apply
to claims that ‘are novel, difficult, refer to disputed legal issues or where claimant has a

tenable or arguable case’.”>4

In light of the standard, few tribunals have accepted Rule 41(5) objections. These
objections have uniformly been accepted for ‘straightforward and _ self-contained
questions that suited themselves to summary determination’? For example, the
Ansung v. China tribunal accepted the objection that a limitation period ousted

temporal jurisdiction,””°

the Emmis v. Hungary tribunal accepted the objection that
non-expropriation claims fell outside of its jurisdiction,””’ and the Globalex v. Ukraine
accepted an objection that the purely commercial contract at issue in that case did not

constitute an investment.?°®

(ii) Factual issues
The standard for a Rule 41(5) objection also indicates that the objection must
specifically be that the claim lacks legal merit. Tribunals have typically understood that

this requirement excludes objections concerning the factual basis of the claim.”*? As the

PNG v. Papua New Guinea tribunal put it, ‘Rule 41(5) is not intended to resolve novel,
difficult or disputed legal issues, but instead only to apply undisputed or genuinely
indisputable rules of law to uncontested facts’? It explained that, ‘[g]iven the
preliminary nature of the proceeding, a tribunal considering a Rule 41(5) application
may not be in a position to decide upon disputed facts’.7°!

However, some tribunals have indicated that they need not accept every factual
allegation. The Trans-Global v. Jordan tribunal stated that ‘the tribunal need not accept
at face value any factual allegation which the tribunal regards as (manifestly) incredible,
frivolous, vexatious or inaccurate or made in bad faith; nor need a tribunal accept a legal
submission dressed up as a factual allegation’.“°? The Ansung v. China tribunal at least
left the door open to ignoring such factual allegations.*°> Nevertheless, it is clear that
only in exceptional circumstances will tribunals ignore or otherwise assess the factual

allegations.

(iii) Jurisdiction and merits

Rule 41(5) does not explicitly state whether the objection that a claim manifestly lacks
legal merit may address only the substantive merits of the claim or may also address
jurisdiction or admissibility. Nevertheless, the tribunals to address this question have
concluded that either legal objections to jurisdiction and admissibility or to the merits

may be raised pursuant to Rule 41(5).?°

(b) Procedural requirements
Rule 41(5) establishes several procedural requirements for seeking an expedited
procedure for an objection that a claim is manifestly without legal merit. It provides

RULE 41 — PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS

the objecting party must file its objection within 30 days of the tribunal’s constitution
and before the first session, and that the parties must have the opportunity to present

observations on the objection.

(i) No alternative procedure requirements

Rule 41(5) only allows a party to submit an objection if the parties have not agreed to a
different procedure for expedited preliminary objections. Tribunals have not extensively
addressed the application of this provision. However, there is some authority that
alternative provisions for expedited objections contained in an investment treaty would
render Rule 41(5) inapplicable.”

(ii) Timing requirements

Rule 41(5) establishes strict timing requirements both for submission of the objection
and for the tribunal’s decision. It provides that a party must file an objection under its
expedited procedure within the first 30 days after the tribunal has been constituted and
before the first session of the tribunal. As the Transglobal v. Panama tribunal concluded,
the rule establishes that these are cumulative requirements, with the infringement of
either making the objection inadmissible.” The rule also imposes strict requirements
for the tribunal’s decision, which must be given as early as at its first session, or promptly
thereafter.”°”

(iii) Written and oral submission requirements

Regarding the procedure itself, Rule 41(5) does not provide extensive instructions other
than that the parties must have the opportunity to present observations. Tribunals are
in general agreement that the procedure must guarantee due process, especially in light
of the possibility that it could end in the dismissal of the claims.?* As the Globalex v.

have a patently unmeritorious claim disposed of before unnecessary trouble and expense

is incurred in defending it, and the duty of the tribunal to meet the requirements of due

process’.?°

Tribunals have generally ensured that parties have had significant opportunities for
written and, where appropriate, oral argument in Rule 41(5) proceedings. The G/obalex
v. Ukraine tribunal explained that ‘it would not be right to non-suit a claimant under
the ICSID system without having allowed the claimant ...a proper opportunity to
be heard, both in writing and orally’.?”° It is common for a Rule 41(5) proceeding to
involve two rounds of written pleadings.?’! Many, but not all, tribunals to consider Rule
41(5) objections have also held oral hearings.”

During the course of the argument, the claimant is generally permitted latitude
to supplement the initial request for arbitration.?” The Alvarez y Marin v. Panama
tribunal observed that, because the claimant only learns of the objection when it
receives the respondent’s written submission, due process requires that it be able to
make responsive factual allegations.?/* However, the supplementation of the request for
arbitration need not imply the submission of evidence, as tribunals typically agree that
Rule 41(5) objections may not be factual but instead must generally assume the facts

as pled.?”>

(c) Consequences of rejected objection

According to Rule 41(5), the decision of the tribunal is without prejudice to submission
of preliminary objections pursuant to Rule 41(1) and to any later objections regarding
the legal merits of the claim. At a minimum, this provision implies that the Rule 41(5)
proceeding is without prejudice to filing other preliminary objections in accordance
with Rule 41(1).

RULE 41 — PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS

However, tribunals have not fully resolved whether a party may submit the very same
preliminary or merits objection again later in the arbitration despite the failure of the
Rule 41(5) objection. On the one hand, the Globalex v. Ukraine tribunal explained that
‘(t]he fact that a claim is not “manifestly” without legal merit does not, self-evidently,
mean that it may not subsequently be found without sufficient legal merit for a tribunal
to uphold it after full argument’.?”° On the other hand, the Transglobal v. Panama
tribunal took the view that ‘a decision pursuant [to Rule] 41(5) rejecting an objection
would be dispositive, but would not deprive Respondent of its right to raise objections
under Rule 41(1) that are distinct from the objections already decided under Rule
41(5)'777

F. Award for lack of jurisdiction, competence, or legal merit (Rule 41(6))

According to Rule 41(6), when the tribunal decides that it lacks jurisdiction or
competence over the entire dispute or that all of the claims manifestly lack legal merit,
the tribunal must issue an award to that effect.?”* The basic interpretation of Rule 41(6)
is uncontroversial. When the decision on preliminary objections ends the dispute, it
must take the form of an award.*” Several tribunals have applied this rule to issue an

award when preliminary objections dispose of the dispute.”°°

The unwritten corollary to Rule 41(6) is that, when the preliminary objections are
insufficient to put an end to the dispute, the tribunal will decide in the form of a
decision and not an award. As the Pac Rim v. El Salvador tribunal explained, ‘[s]ince
decisions affirming jurisdiction are limited to the settlement of jurisdictional questions
prior to issues as to the merits, they do not have the status of an award under the ICSID

Convention until their incorporation into the award that addresses all questions and

thus decides the parties’ dispute’.?*! An ICSID arbitration can have only a single award,

which would normally incorporate all of the prior decisions.”*

The primary consequence of the difference between a decision and an award under
Rule 41(6) is the immediate availability of remedies under the ICSID Convention.
The Pac Rim v. El Salvador tribunal observed that these remedies ‘do not apply to
preliminary decisions affirming jurisdiction until their incorporation in the later
award’.?*3 However, it is still a matter of some controversy whether the tribunal itself
might revisit its decision on preliminary objections prior to issuing the award.7** By
contrast, the Lemire v. Ukraine annulment committee stated that an award under Rule
41(6) ‘would be subject to the remedies provided by the ICSID Convention, which

include interpretation, rectification and ultimate annulment of the award’.?®°

When the tribunal resolves a Rule 41(5) procedure against the claimant, it may
be required to issue an award under Rule 41(6). The Rule 41(5) procedure assesses
whether the claims manifestly lack legal merit. The 2006 modification to the Rules
that introduced Rule 41(5) complemented it with an additional clause of Rule 41(6)
allowing an award when all claims are found to be manifestly without legal merit.
Several tribunals have indeed confirmed that this addition to Rule 41(6) results in an
award when the Rule 41(5) proceeding is dispositive of the dispute.7°°

questions submitted to it and to render an award.

(2) The Tribunal shall promptly notify the defaulting party of such a request. Unless

1. INTRODUCTION

Rule 42, which codifies and expands upon Article 45 of the ICSID Convention, is 25.196
somewhat more detailed than default provisions in other international arbitration
rules, and establishes: (1) a mandatory grace period in the event a party fails to make a
submission or appear at a hearing; (2) in the event of a default, the arbitral proceedings

shall continue if requested by the appearing party; (3) the appearing party must establish

its entitlement to relief notwithstanding the default; and (4) the tribunal is affirmatively
required to protect the interests of the defaulting party. This commentary describes
ICSID awards interpreting Rule 42, and compares Rule 42 to the default rules and

practice under other institutional rules.

25.197 Article 45 of the ICSID Convention states:

(1) Failure of a party to appear or to present his case shall not be deemed an
admission of the other party’s assertions.

(2) Ifa party fails to appear or to present his case at any stage of the proceedings the
other party may request the Tribunal to deal with the questions submitted to
it and to render an award. Before rendering an award,the Tribunal shall notify,
and grant a period of grace to, the party failing to appear or to present its case,
unless it is satisfied that that party does not intend to do so.

25.198 Rule 42 is unchanged since the ICSID Rules were originally published in 1968. The

notes to the original Rule 42” state:

A. [In the event of failure of a party to appear] [t]he Tribunal must continue to
discharge its task if it is requested to do so (see Article 45(2) of the Convention).
And if it does so and renders its award, the latter is binding on both parties-as a
consequence of the mutual consent on which the jurisdiction of the Tribunal is
based.

B. A request pursuant to paragraph (1) may emanate from either party to the
dispute, not only from the party that made the original request for the institution
of the proceeding. It can be made ‘at any stage’ but must be made ‘prior to the
discontinuance of the proceeding.’ Since neither the Tribunal nor the defaulting
party should be exposed indefinitely to a re-opening of the proceeding, if neither
party takes any step in the proceeding during six consecutive months (i.e., if one
party defaults and the other fails to make a request pursuant to Rule 42(1) within
six months), the Tribunal must take action to discontinue the proceeding pursuant
to Rule 45.

C. An immediate consequence of the request [by the non-defaulting party] is that
the defaulting party must be placed on notice and granted a ‘period of grace’

(as required by Article 45(2) of the Convention), which under paragraph (2)

of this Rule may not, without the consent of the other party, exceed 60 days

(since presumably the defaulting party already had adequate time to prepare its

case before the default). However, such a period need not be granted where the

Tribunal is satisfied that the defaulting party does not intend to participate in

the proceeding — e.g., because it has made a formal declaration to that effect.

Otherwise the granting of the period is obligatory.

D. In conformity with Article 45(2) of the Convention, the Tribunal is ‘to deal with
the questions submitted to it and render an award’. ‘The Tribunal is therefore
not confined to making an award in favor of the party appearing; it may instead
decline its jurisdiction or render an award in favor of the defaulting party (see
Note E, below).

E. In accordance with Article 45(1) of the Convention, paragraph (3) of this Rule
provides that neither the default nor the request should prejudice the substance of
the decision of the Tribunal. Neither affects the substantive rights of the parties or
any earlier submission; they only alter their procedural position: After the Tribunal
has, on the expiration of the period of grace, resumed consideration of the request,
the proceeding is no longer fully ‘contentious’ in the sense that expression is used
in national civil procedures; the initiative is shifted to the Tribunal as far as the
substantiation of the submissions is concerned. The Tribunal must now proprio
motu [on its own impulse] examine: (a) whether the dispute comes within the
jurisdiction of the Centre and otherwise within its own competence (as to its
inherent powers in this respect, see also Rule 41(2)); the Tribunal must, even if
its jurisdiction has not been contested by the parties, end the proceeding unless it
is satisfied that it is competent (Rule 41(5)); and (b) the substantive merit of the
‘assertions’ made by both parties in order to satisfy itself whether their submissions
are well-founded in fact and law. To this end, it may call on the active party for

observations, evidence or explanations.

It does not appear that Rule 42 is a particular focus of current efforts to revise the 25.199
ICSID Arbitration Rules, commenced by ICSID in October 2016.°”

2. RULE 42 DEFAULT PROCEDURE

In all international arbitration proceedings, a tribunal faced with a delinquent or 25.200
unresponsive party must determine whether a default has in fact occurred and, if so,

how to proceed. Generally, in international arbitration, as noted by Gary Born:

a tribunal is not a court, empowered to issue a default judgment predicated simply on
one party’s non-participation. Rather, the tribunal is responsible for assessing the issues

presented to it; a party’s non participation does not abrogate that obligation.”

A party may refuse or otherwise fail to participate from the outset of the arbitration or 25.201
at any time thereafter. Whether a party’s failure to make a submission or present its case

in any particular instance amounts to a default is a fact-specific inquiry.”

Chapter 25 PARTICULAR PROCEDURES

As discussed below, unlike other international arbitration rules, Rule 42 makes clear
that in the event of a default, an ICSID tribunal must continue to proceed to determine
the issues before it if requested to do so by the appearing party, and an ICSID tribunal
has an affirmative obligation to determine whether it has jurisdiction and whether the
submissions of the appearing party ‘are well-founded in fact and law’.*” In some cases
it may even be that appearing party’s claims and proofs face more heightened scrutiny
by an ICSID tribunal than would be the case if the defaulting party had actively

participated in the case.’”*
A. Delays in submissions or hearings

As to whether a default has in fact occurred, the few published orders and awards
concerning Rule 42(2) make clear that ICSID tribunals rarely, if ever, declare a default
if a party requests additional time to make a submission or appear at a hearing. Rather,
tribunals make every effort to accommodate and ensure the participation of all parties

in the arbitral proceedings. As the tribunal explained in EuroGas Inc. v. Slovak Republic:

The procedure in default is not a sanction for procedural shortcomings that is imposed
automatically once a party has failed to take certain procedural steps. Rather, it is a
measure of last resort that is taken once the tribunal has reached the conclusion that
there is no realistic chance to secure cooperation.?”

For example, in Arif v. Republic of Moldova, respondent Moldova had agreed to submit
its counter-memorial on 21 March 2012." On 20 March 2012, Moldova requested
an extension, arguing that the outcome in a parallel proceeding before the European
Court of Human Rights (ECHR) might affect the ICSID proceeding. The claimant
requested the tribunal to reject this request and order Moldova to submit its counter-
memorial immediately or otherwise consider Moldova in default under Rule 42. On 28
March, the tribunal ordered the respondent to submit its counter-memorial immedi-
ately on ground that the ECHR proceeding was not similar to the ICSID arbitration.
The tribunal further stated it would only consider such a request for default should
Moldova fail to do as instructed.” Two days later, on 30 March, Moldova appointed
counsel (it had not previously appointed external legal representation) and on 2 April
2012 — the same day the claimant submitted that any jurisdictional objection would be
time-barred under Rule 41(1) — submitted another proposal to amend the schedule.

party).

RULE 42 — DEFAULT

The tribunal granted this extension and did not bar the respondent from objecting to
jurisdiction. The respondent ultimately filed its counter-memorial on 31 May 2012 and
the arbitration then proceeded, with various additional extensions being granted to

both parties before hearings were held and an award rendered.’”

In Benvenuti & Bonfant v. Peoples Republic of the Congo, the tribunal ‘considered
that special circumstances of a domestic political nature had prevented the normal
functioning of certain Congolese State agencies, and these were such as to explain the
Government’s failure to comply with the successive time limits fixed by the Tribunal’ in

granting continued requests for the respondent to file pleadings and evidence.’”

25.205

Tribunals have also postponed hearings rather than find a default. In Ickale Insaat 25.206

Limited Sirketi v. Turkmenistan, counsel for Turkmenistan notified the tribunal on 15
August 2013 that counsel would not be able to proceed with the hearings as scheduled to
take place in October 2013 because counsel and Turkmenistan were still in discussions
regarding financial arrangements.*° On 20 August, the claimant requested that the
tribunal find Turkmenistan in default pursuant to Rule 42. On 26 August, the tribunal
issued an order which stated that ‘the situation did not fall within ICSID Arbitration
Rule 42’ and granted an extension to the respondent. The hearings were ultimately held
in May 2014.°""

B. Defaults relating to jurisdiction and competence

Rule 42(4) requires that, in the event of a default, ICSID tribunals examine jurisdiction
and whether the tribunal is competent to decide the matter before considering the
merits of the dispute and that the failure of a respondent to appear cannot be considered
an admission of either of these elements.*” The explicit requirement in Rule 42(4) that
a tribunal affirmatively determine jurisdiction and competence has been attributable to

the particular character of ICSID arbitration involving nation-States.*

In accordance with Rule 42(4), ICSID tribunals have in fact examined their
jurisdiction and competence before considering the merits of the dispute. In three

ICSID arbitrations commenced against Jamaica in the 1970s concerning bauxite

mining, Jamaica failed to file papers in opposition to claimants’ submissions concerning
jurisdiction.** The tribunals examined jurisdiction proprio motu and considered any
objections that may have been raised by Jamaica.*® Ten years later, in LETCO v. Liberia,
when Liberia failed to respond to the tribunal’s notifications or appear for hearings,
the tribunal required the claimant to submit additional evidence on jurisdiction”
Since LETCO, ICSID tribunals have resolved jurisdictional and/or competence issues

without State submissions in at least four other cases.>°”

As the tribunal in Ambiente Ufficio 8.p.A. v. Argentine Republic stated regarding Goerz

and others v. Republic of Burundi,*® a case in which a respondent defaulted:

The Tribunal in the Goetz case was well aware that it was called upon to assure itself
whether there was jurisdiction in the dispute in question, even more so in cases of
default where the respondent State is not present to defend its rights. The Goerz
Tribunal thus expressly referred to Arbitration Rule 42 para. 4, also part of Rule 42
on ‘Default’, according to which ‘[t]he Tribunal shall examine the jurisdiction of the
Centre and its own competence in the dispute, and, if it is satisfied, decide whether the
submissions are well-founded in fact and in law (emphasis added). Accordingly, if the
Tribunal had had doubts as to the lack of a sufficient link between the claimants as an
obstacle to its jurisdiction, it would have had to bring them up.*”

C. Defaults relating to merits
Rule 42(4) also requires ICSID tribunals to consider if the ‘submissions made are

well-founded in fact and in law’. Rule 42 codifies the requirement in Article 45 that

and specifically provides that the tribunal has the authority to request additional
submissions or evidence from the appearing party.

In LETCO v. Liberia, the tribunal stated: 25.211

the failure of the Government of Liberia to take part in the present arbitral proceedings
does not entitle the claimant to an award in its favor as a matter of right. The onus is

still upon the claimant to establish the claim which it has put forward in its Request for

Arbitration and other documents.*"!

Indeed, the LETCO tribunal appointed an accountant firm to review, investigate, and 25.212

report on the claimant’s damages estimate.*”

In Goetz and others v. Republic of Burundi a tribunal ruled against the claimant on 25.213
certain liability issues even though the respondent failed to participate in the matter’?
Although the Tribunal found that Burundi had failed to pay ‘adequate and effective
compensation’,*"* Burundi ‘still had an opportunity to remain in compliance with the

BIT, subject to payment of the compensation without undue delay’ 3”

In addition to LETCO and Goerz, there are at least two other cases in which ICSID 25.214
tribunals have issued awards on the merits where the respondent has been in default.*"°

3. COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS

The default procedure in Rule 42 differs from default provisions in other international 25.215

arbitration rules in several ways.

The author is not aware of any institutional rule analogous to the mandatory 60-day 25.216
grace period in Rule 42, which may be attributed to a desire to provide State respondents
in ICSID cases every opportunity to participate in the proceedings.“ As a practical

matter, arbitral tribunals acting under other rules would be expected to exercise great

311 Liberian Eastern Timber (n 307) Award (31 March 1986). See Rayfuse (n 306) 356 (emphasis in original).

default. See CPR Global Rules for Accelerated Commercial Arbitration (CPR Rules’) (August 2009) r 14.

care in declaring a default since any perceived failure to provide a party with a fair
opportunity to be heard could be grounds to set aside the award.*"

Also, while international arbitration rules typically provide a tribunal with discretion
to proceed with the arbitration and render an award absent a showing of good cause
for the default,*"” Rule 42(3) states that upon a default ‘the Tribunal sha// resume the
consideration of the dispute’ (emphasis added). Other arbitration rules typically allow
tribunals to choose whether or not to proceed.*”? In practice, of course, it is generally
the case that if the respondent fails to take part in the arbitral proceedings, the claimant
will request that the proceedings continue, and the claimant remains obligated to prove

its case.*?!

Rule 42(4) also differs from other default provisions in that it specifically requires
the tribunal to examine its jurisdiction and competence and determine whether the

822 and provides the

appearing party’s submissions are ‘well-founded in fact and law
tribunal with authority to gather additional evidence to that end as necessary. Only
the ad oc UNCITRAL Rules and a few institutional rules specifically state, like Rule
42, that a respondent’s failure to respond is not to be treated as an admission of the
claimant’s assertions.*”? The SCC Rules permit the tribunal to ‘draw such inferences as
it considers appropriate’ if a party fails to comply with any requirement under the SCC

Rules or any tribunal procedural order.*”*

RULES 43-45

Finally, some other rules distinguish between default of a claimant and respondent at
the start of proceedings and provide for termination of the arbitration if the claimant
fails to file its statement of claim.*”° For example, UNCITRAL and SCC Rules state
the tribunal ‘shall terminate the proceedings’ if the claimant fails to file a statement of
claim*’* but that the tribunal ‘shall order that the proceedings continue’ if a respondent
fails to submit a response.*”” By contrast, an ICSID tribunal is affirmatively obligated
to continue with the proceeding at any stage if so requested by the appearing party
following expiration of the mandatory grace period.

4. CONCLUSION

By providing a mandatory 60-day grace period for a defaulting party and requiring that
the proceedings continue and the tribunal affirmatively determine issues of jurisdiction,
competence and merits, Rule 42 ensures that parties will be given every opportunity to
participate in proceedings and that ICSID cases will be determined on the facts and

law.

to pursue the proceedings for any reason. Discontinuance may also occur if the parties
fail to act for a certain period of time, in which case the Tribunal, or if appropriate the

Secretary-General, may order discontinuance of the pending proceedings.*”

Regulation 14(3)(d) of the Administrative and Financial Regulations**’ also provides
for a mechanism of discontinuance where the inaction of the parties relates to the
non-payment of the advances and supplemental charges due to the Centre pursuant to

Regulation 14(3)(a) of the Administrative and Financial Regulations.

As indicated in the Preamble, the Arbitration Rules ‘cover the period of time from
the dispatch of the notice of registration of a request for arbitration until an award is

rendered and all challenges possible to it under the Convention have been exhausted’***

Rules 43 to 45 will therefore apply only after the ICSID Secretariat has registered the
request for arbitration. Before registration, a claimant may unilaterally withdraw its

request for arbitration without first notifying the other party or obtaining its consent.*®

The reference in the Preamble to ‘all challenges possible to [the award]’ suggests that
Rules 43 to 45 continue to apply after a final award has been rendered, i.e. when requests
for rectification, interpretation, or revision and annulment proceedings initiated

pursuant to Articles 49(2) to 52 of the ICSID Convention are pending.

Settling a dispute may preserve commercial relations between parties for the future,
where lengthy, expensive and burdensome arbitration, which is generally a last resort
solution, will not. The same objective is pursued when parties are prevented from

leaving arbitrations inactive for a long period of time.

According to ICSID statistics, 34 per cent of arbitration proceedings under the ICSID
Convention and the Additional Facility Rules are ultimately settled or otherwise

discontinued.***

This substantial rate is achieved through the mechanism of settlement and
discontinuance, governed by Rules 43 to 45 of the Arbitration Rules, Articles 49

332 Arbitration Rules, Rule 45; Article 51 of the Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules.

RULE 43 — SETTLEMENT AND DISCONTINUANCE
ALEXANDRA Munoz AND TEss PIcKARD

(1) If, before the award is rendered, the parties agree on a settlement of the dispute
or otherwise to discontinue the proceeding, the Tribunal, or the Secretary-
General if the Tribunal has not yet been constituted, shall, at their written
request, in an order take note of the discontinuance of the proceeding.

(b) If the parties file with the Secretary-General the full and signed text of their
settlement and in writing request the Tribunal to embody such settlement in an

award, the Tribunal may record the settlement in the form of its award.

1, RULE 43(1): ORDER TAKING NOTE OF THE DISCONTINUANCE OF THE
PROCEEDING BY THE TRIBUNAL OR SECRETARY-GENERAL

Rule 43(1) will be invoked by the parties if they both wish to discontinue the proceeding, 25.230
for any reason (for example to substitute a conciliation proceeding), without an award

being rendered.
A. The request: a joint written request by the parties

Discontinuance under Rule 43(1) is exclusively subject to the joint initiative of the 25.231
parties in the form of a written request. Such joint initiative will usually take the form of

a written request by one party that is followed by its acceptance by the other party(ies)

to the dispute.

A request under Rule 43(1) has to be made to the Tribunal, or to the Secretary- 25.232
General if the Tribunal is not yet constituted, who has the power to take note of the

discontinuance in the form of an order.

337 In this regard, the Preamble of the ICSID Convention recalls ‘the need for international cooperation for economic

development, and the role of private international investment thereir’.

Chapter 25 PARTICULAR PROCEDURES

B. The order taking note of discontinuance: a duty for the Tribunal or the Secretary-
General if the Tribunal is not yet constituted

If the Tribunal has already been constituted, it is required to issue an order taking note

of discontinuance.

If the joint request is submitted before the Tribunal is constituted, the Secretary-
General has the same power and authority as the Tribunal. This authority conferred
upon the Secretary-General avoids the necessity of constituting the Tribunal merely

for this purpose and may be explained by ‘the consensual character of this procedure’.***

C. The order taking note of discontinuance: the effects
The order taking note of the discontinuance has the effect of terminating the proceeding.

Regardless of whether it is issued by the Tribunal or the Secretary-General, the order
taking note of the discontinuance is not an award but an order. As such, provisions
applicable to an award will not apply to it.

Therefore, Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention,*”’ which requires the Tribunal to
deal with every question submitted to it and to state the reasons upon which the award
is based, will not apply. The Tribunal will not deal with any questions submitted to
it prior to the request for discontinuance and is not under the obligation to give any
reasons for the order except that the parties have reached an agreement to discontinue

the proceeding.

Moreover, the order will not be subject to rectification (Article 49(2)), interpretation
(Article 50), revision (Article 51) or annulment (Article 52) under the ICSID

Convention.

Furthermore, the order would not normally contain any provision regarding the
allocation of expenses in accordance with Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention.
However, there is a growing tendency on the part of ICSID Tribunals to make use of
the general powers conferred upon them to allocate the costs of arbitral proceedings,

even in orders taking note of discontinuance (see below)

338 1968 Regulations and Rules, Part D, Rule 43, Note B.
339 Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention provides that ‘[t]he award shall deal with every question submitted to the
Tribunal, and shall state the reasons upon which it is based’.

RULE 43 — SETTLEMENT AND DISCONTINUANCE

Finally, the ICSID Convention provisions on recognition and enforcement of an award
(Articles 53, 54 and 55) will not apply to the order rendered by the Tribunal or the
Secretary-General. The order will therefore not be capable of being enforced as an

award.
D. Consequences for reinstating claims

Unless the parties agree otherwise, discontinuance under Rule 43(1) is made ‘without
prejudice’, which means that a party may file a new Request for Arbitration if the other

party has not complied with the terms of the settlement agreement.

In practice, however, it is unlikely that a respondent party would accept such
discontinuance without assurance of the full and final discontinuance of the pending

dispute.*”

That being said, where a discontinuance order is issued on a ‘with prejudice’ basis
under Rule 43(1) (as opposed to an award being issued under Rule 43(2)), if the
claimant reinstates its claims at a later stage, such reinstatement of the claim will not
constitute a violation of an award or the ICSID Convention, but only a breach of the
parties’ settlement agreement and of the order. Indeed, the Convention provisions on
recognition and enforcement only apply to a settlement embodied within an award
pursuant to Rule 43(2).

This limitation may thus encourage parties to request the Tribunal to embody their

settlement in an award pursuant to Rule 43(2).

2. RULE 43(2): SETTLEMENT RECORDED IN AN AWARD

If the parties reach a settlement while the dispute is pending, they may, pursuant to Rule
43(2), request the Tribunal to embody the terms agreed between them in an award.

340 To see an illustration: Aéaclat (n 71) Decision on jurisdiction and admissibility (4 August 2011), para. 624; Corporacién
Quiport S.A. and others v. Republic of Ecuador, Order taking note of the discontinuance (11 November 2011),
ARB/09/23: the Secretary-General took note of the discontinuance of the proceeding in accordance with Rule 43(1)
of the Arbitration Rules and referred to the parties’ agreement to the discontinuance with prejudice of certain listed

claims.

Chapter 25 PARTICULAR PROCEDURES

Most major institutional rules provide for a similar mechanism for the parties to
embody their settlement in an award when they reach a settlement while the dispute is

pending.*?
A. The request: a joint written request by the parties

In the same vein as discontinuance under Rule 43(1), settlement and discontinuance
under Rule 43(2) is exclusively subject to a joint initiative of the parties, which takes the

form of a written request.

A request under Rule 43(2) has to be made to the Tribunal once constituted. The
Secretary-General has no power to issue awards. Parties may therefore be tempted to
await the constitution of the Tribunal before requesting it to embody their settlement

in an award.

However, as with consent awards under the rules of different institutions,” the
parties cannot ask ICSID to appoint the Tribunal for the sole purposes of issuing a
consent award. Indeed, as the existence of a dispute is an objective requirement for the

jurisdiction of the Centre,*¥

if the parties reach a settlement prior to the institution of
arbitration proceedings, such settlement should not be embodied in an award under
Rule 43(2), as in such case there would be no dispute between the parties. Indeed,
pursuant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention, the Secretary-General would have
to refuse the registration of a request for arbitration that reveals the absence of a dispute

for it would be ‘manifestly outside the jurisdiction of the Centre’.°“

B. The award embodying the parties’ settlement: the discretion of the Tribunal

The Tribunal has the discretion to grant or to refuse to grant an award. If the Tribunal

refuses to grant an award it will take note of the discontinuance in an order.

RULE 43 — SETTLEMENT AND DISCONTINUANCE

The Arbitration Rules are silent as to the factors to be taken into consideration by the
Tribunal to determine whether to exercise its discretion to comply with the request to
embody the parties’ settlement in an award.

Although some awards have been published,** most awards embodying settlement
agreements remain unpublished.* Moreover, it is difficult to know how often ICSID
Tribunals decline to render awards on the basis of Rule 43(2). It is not unreasonable to
hypothesise that such a scenario is rare as the purpose of ICSID arbitration is to provide
a means for resolving disputes and as such Tribunals should promote the finding of an

amicable solution.

According to the non-binding explanatory notes that were published with the
Arbitration Rules in 1986, which are not part of the Rules, the “Tribunal is given
discretion on whether to comply with such a request, since it may instead decide that
it lacks jurisdiction [...], or that it considers it improper for the Tribunal to become a

party to a particular settlement’.*”

The factors to be taken into consideration by the Tribunal to determine whether to
exercise its discretion to comply with the request to embody the parties’ settlement in
an award ought thus to be two-fold.

First, pursuant to Rule 41 of the Arbitration Rules, the Tribunal must decide on its
jurisdiction to hear the dispute. Even though the Tribunal does not decide on the
merits, it does dispose of the dispute. Therefore, the parties must have settled a genuinely
arbitrable dispute, and the Tribunal must find that it has the authority to resolve the
dispute.

In this regard, for the parties to reach a successful settlement, they should only consider

requesting an ICSID Tribunal to embody their settlement in the form of an award if

they are sure that it has the authority to resolve the dispute pursuant to Article 25 of
the ICSID Convention and pursuant to the instrument under which the arbitration is

commenced.

Second, in deciding whether to render an award embodying the parties’ settlement, a
tribunal would be expected to bear in mind the risk that settlement under Rule 43(2)

may be used for improper purposes, such as money laundering.

It is the duty of an arbitral tribunal to render an enforceable award and it goes without
saying that the Tribunal would want to ensure that it did not neglect this duty and so it

would want to ensure that any settlement embodied in an award is enforceable.

It is only when there are obvious, well-founded grounds for refusing to grant an award,
that an arbitral tribunal should refuse the parties’ request to render an award embodying
their settlement under Rule 43(2). Such grounds, we suggest, should be the violation
of public policy or any applicable mandatory rules, and not simply the unconscionable

nature of the settlement terms for one of the parties.
C. The award embodying the parties’ settlement: the effects

When a Tribunal renders an award under Rule 43(2), the settlement agreement acquires

the force of an award rendered pursuant to the Convention.

In this regard, the Convention’s provisions on recognition and enforcement of an
award (Articles 53,54 and 55) will apply. This is the major advantage for the parties of
choosing an award rather than an order as each Contracting State shall recognise the
award rendered pursuant to Rule 43(2) as binding and enforce the pecuniary obligations
imposed by that award within its territories as if it were a final judgment of a court in
that State.** Failure by the State party to comply with such an award is a violation of
the Convention and may even trigger diplomatic protection under Article 27 of the
Convention. Enforceability of the award is most likely the main reason why parties may
wish to have their settlement recorded in an award.

Moreover, the award will contain provisions regarding the apportionment of costs in
accordance with Article 61(2) of the Convention. In case of a settlement, the parties
can propose an apportionment of costs for endorsement by the Tribunal.*” The parties

can also agree to let the Tribunal decide.*° In the absence of any agreement on the
allocation of costs, it falls on the Tribunal to decide.

Certain provisions of the ICSID Convention will however be less relevant to an award
rendered pursuant to Rule 43(2).

In this regard, we consider that Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention,*! which
requires the Tribunal to deal with every question submitted to it and to state the reasons
upon which the award is based, applies but its conditions are easily met by the Tribunal.
Indeed, the Tribunal only needs to recite the fact that the parties have agreed the issues
that were in dispute and that have been settled. In terms of reasons for the award, the
Tribunal only needs to recite as reasons the existence of a settlement and the existence
of a joint application under Rule 43(2).

Moreover, the award will be subject to post-award remedies. However, their application
will be restricted. Rectification (Article 49) will apply to it. Interpretation (Article 50)
will be however largely restricted as there is little sense in the Tribunal interpreting the
settlement reached by the parties. Revision (Article 51) will be largely reserved for a
scenario involving the discovery of new facts. Annulment (Article 52) grounds would
have incredibly limited application. While the tribunal’s improper constitution may be
invoked, some grounds would not apply at all, such as failure to state the reasons on

which it is based (Article 52(1)(e)).

Finally, it should be noted that it is open to parties to settle certain but not all aspects
of their dispute. In such a case, there will be no discontinuance and the proceedings will
carry on in respect of those issues that are not the object of a settlement. In practice, the
Tribunal will incorporate a partial settlement into its award while deciding other parts
of the dispute,*” or it may issue a partial award for the issues that have been settled, and

issue a final award on all other issues later on.

RULE 44 —- DISCONTINUANCE AT REQUEST OF A PARTY
ALEXANDRA Munoz anv Tess PicKarD

If a party requests the discontinuance of the proceeding, the Tribunal, or the
Secretary-General if the Tribunal has not yet been constituted, shall in an order
fix a time limit within which the other party may state whether it opposes the
discontinuance. If no objection is made in writing within the time limit, the other
party shall be deemed to have acquiesced in the discontinuance and the Tribunal, orif
appropriate the Secretary-General shall in an order take note of the discontinuance

of the proceeding. If objection is made, the proceeding shall continue.

1. INTRODUCTION

Rule 44 provides for the discontinuance of proceedings at the unilateral request of one
party. Discontinuance under Rule 44 is however subject to the mutual consent of the
parties. Such consent can be implicit (no opposition to the other party’s request for

discontinuance).

Rule 44 is therefore similar to Rule 43(1), but applicable in cases where a claimant
decides not to pursue its claim or a respondent decides not to defend the claims made
against it, and no particular settlement agreement is reached.

2. THE REQUEST: A UNILATERAL REQUEST FROM ONE OF THE PARTIES
TO THE DISPUTE

The request is made by one of the parties to the dispute, which can be the claimant
or the respondent to the dispute, although publicly available case law shows that the

request usually originates from the claimant to the proceeding.

While it is not expressly stated in the wording of Rule 44, a request for the
discontinuance of the proceeding will invariably be made in writing by the party

requesting discontinuance of the proceeding.
q g p g

However, practically, under this Rule, the agreement (express or implied) of both parties

must be secured for discontinuance.

RULE 44 — DISCONTINUANCE AT REQUEST OF A PARTY

A request under Rule 44 has to be made to the Arbitral Tribunal or to the Secretary-
General, if the Tribunal is not yet constituted, who has the power to take note of the
discontinuance and terminate the proceeding. The possibility for the Secretary-General
to take note of the discontinuance avoids the necessity of constituting the Tribunal
merely for this purpose.

3. THE DISCONTINUANCE ORDER: A DUTY FORTHE TRIBUNAL OR THE
SECRETARY-GENERAL

After it receives a request for discontinuance, the Tribunal shall fix a time limit within
which the other party is required to react. If the other party agrees to discontinue
the proceeding or does not raise any objection in writing within the time limit, the

discontinuance is granted.

If a request is made under Rule 44, the Tribunal, or the Secretary-General, is required

to make an order taking note of the discontinuance.

4. THE ORDER TAKING NOTE OF DISCONTINUANCE: THE EFFECTS

The order taking note of the discontinuance is not an award but an order. For a discussion
of the effects of an order taking note of discontinuance, see the developments in the
commentary above concerning Rule 43(1) (para. 25.230).

5. DISCONTINUANCE OF RECTIFICATION, INTERPRETATION, REVISION AND
ANNULMENT PROCEEDINGS

As mentioned above, Rules 43 to 45 also apply to “all challenges possible to [the award]’,
i.e. to rectification, interpretation, revision and annulment proceedings initiated

pursuant to Articles 49(2) to 52 of the ICSID Convention.

With regard to these proceedings, extra caution should be exercised by parties and

practitioners due to the specific deadlines applicable thereto.
For example, pursuant to Article 52(2) of the Convention, an application for annulment

of an award must be made within 120 days after the date on which the award was
rendered. Pursuant to Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention, if a party applies for

rectification of the award, this same period of time to apply for annulment of an award

‘shall run from the date on which the decision was rendered’.

However, in the scenario where a party decides to discontinue its application for
rectification of the award, one can question the effect of the discontinuance of the
rectification proceeding on the time period for applying for annulment of the award. As
no ‘decision’ in the sense of an award will have intervened pursuant to the rectification
proceeding, it is questionable whether the order taking note of discontinuance would
amount to a ‘decision’ from which the time period is deemed to have started to run or if
the time period within which the application for annulment of the award must be made

would start to run from the award.

The latter solution seems particularly strict as it could unduly prevent parties from
applying for annulment of an award, and in light of this difficulty, may encourage
parties to maintain rectification proceedings that aver to be unnecessary in order to
have a ‘decision from which the 120-day period will start to run to apply for annulment

of the award.

To avoid such legal insecurity, parties may consider submitting a precautionary
application for annulment to avoid being time-barred and request the postponement of
the examination of the application for annulment until the issuance of the decision of

the Tribunal on the rectification of the award.
6. CONSEQUENCES FOR REINSTATING CLAIMS
For a discussion of the consequences of reinstating claims, see the developments in the
commentary above concerning Rule 43(1) (para. 25.230).
7. CONSEQUENCES FOR MASS CLAIMS
Mass claims raise specific issues when it comes to discontinuance.
As previously indicated, it is clear that parties can settle (and therefore request

discontinuance) of part of their dispute. In a similar vein, it is also possible, in cases

where there are multiple claimants, for some but not all claimants to withdraw their

claims and seek discontinuance whilst the dispute continues amongst the remaining

parties. This hypothesis is covered by the same rules as regular discontinuance.**

In the Abaclat case, the consent of the respondent to discontinue under Rule 44 was
subject to the claimants who wished to discontinue their proceeding agreeing to certain
terms with which they had to comply. These conditions were two-fold; on the one hand,
claimants were required to agree to the ‘full and final’ character of the discontinuance,
i.e. discontinuance with prejudice to reinstatement of the claims, and on the other
hand, a specific allocation of costs.** After finding the respondent’s conditions to be
acceptable, the Tribunal found that the proceedings were discontinued with regard to

certain claimants.°>

RULE 45 — DISCONTINUANCE FOR FAILURE OF PARTIES TO ACT
ALEXANDRA Munoz anv Tess PicKARD

If the parties fail to take any steps in the proceeding during six consecutive
months or such period as they may agree with the approval of the Tribunal, or of
the Secretary-General if the Tribunal has not yet been constituted, they shall be
deemed to have discontinued the proceeding and the Tribunal, or if appropriate
the Secretary-General, shall, after notice to the parties, in an order take note of the

discontinuance.

Rule 45 is useful to allow the Tribunal or the Secretary-General, if appropriate or if the
Tribunal is not constituted, to put an end to proceedings that have been abandoned by
the parties. There is only one publicly available example of discontinuance pursuant to
Rule 45 to date.*° Discontinuance under Rule 45 has been ordered in other cases, but

the decisions in those cases remain unpublished.**”

Chapter 25 PARTICULAR PROCEDURES

Rule 45 pursues judicial economy. The idea underlying Rule 45 is that if, for six months,
no action is taken by the parties, it can be presumed that they have abandoned the

proceeding and are no longer interested in a decision on their dispute.***

1. DISCONTINUANCE SUBJECT TO THE INITIATIVE OF THE TRIBUNAL OR THE
SECRETARY-GENERAL

Discontinuance under Rule 45 is subject to the initiative of the Tribunal or the

Secretary-General, if appropriate or if the Tribunal is not constituted.

Before ordering the discontinuance of the proceedings, the Tribunal or the Secretary-
General must give the parties notice of its intention to discontinue the proceeding.
There is a six-month period during which parties are able to respond although the
Tribunal may agree to extend this period if the parties, for instance, are in the course of

negotiating a settlement.

2. THE ORDER TAKING NOTE OF DISCONTINUANCE: THE EFFECTS

The order taking note of the discontinuance, whether issued by the Tribunal or the
Secretary-general, is not an award but an order. For a discussion of the consequences of
such a distinction, see above in the commentary to Rule 43(1) (para. 25.230).

3. INACTION OF THE PARTIES IN THE FORM OF NON-PAYMENT OF THE
ADVANCES AND SUPPLEMENTAL CHARGES DUE TO THE CENTRE

If the inaction of the parties relates to the non-payment of the advances and
supplemental charges due to the Centre pursuant to Regulation 14(3)(a) of the
Administrative and Financial Regulations, then the Secretary-General may invite the
Tribunal to stay the proceedings before the funds previously received have been entirely
exhausted. If proceedings are stayed on this basis for more than six months, then the
Secretary-General may, pursuant to Regulation 14(3)(d) of the Administrative and

Financial Regulations, invite the Tribunal to discontinue the proceedings altogether.

The administrative and financial regulations automatically apply to any arbitration

proceedings.

RULE 45 — DISCONTINUANCE FOR FAILURE OF PARTIES TO ACT

4. THE ISSUE OF ALLOCATION OF COSTS IN AN ORDER TAKING NOTE OF
DISCONTINUANCE

Orders are not awards. It therefore follows that orders taking note of discontinuance
under Rules 43(1), 44 and 45 would not normally contain any provision regarding the
allocation of expenses in accordance with Article 61(2) of the Convention (see above in

the commentary on the development of Rule 43(1), para. 25.230).

In this respect, the non-binding explanatory notes that were published with the
Arbitration Rules in 1968 state that an order for discontinuance, ‘whether issued by the
Tribunal or the Secretary-General, is not an award, and therefore would not normally
contain any provision regarding the division of expenses in accordance with Article
61(2) of the Convention’.*”

However, Tribunals have recently questioned whether, if requested by a party, they can

and should provide for the allocation of costs when ordering discontinuance.

Analysis of recent case law shows that there is a growing tendency on the part of
Tribunals to make use of the general powers conferred upon them to allocate the costs

of arbitral proceedings, even in orders taking note of discontinuance.

It is to be noted that only the Tribunal has the power to allocate costs as the Secretary-
General does not have the authority under the ICSID Convention to rule on the
allocation of costs, thus the following developments relate only to the scenario whereby

the Tribunal is constituted when the proceeding is discontinued.

Moreover, the question of allocation of costs in the discontinuance order only arises
when this issue has not already been agreed upon between the parties. Indeed, the parties
sometimes agree to bear their own costs. In such scenario, there is no need to determine

whether or not the Tribunal has the power to allocate costs in a discontinuance order.
A. The relevant provisions

Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 47(1)(j) of the Arbitration Rules are
to be considered when addressing the question of the Tribunal’s power to allocate costs

in an order taking note of discontinuance.

359 1968 Regulations and Rules, Part D, Rule 44, Note D.
360 See, e.g.: Impregilo (n 243) Order taking note of the discontinuance (25 September 2005), para. 6.

Chapter 25 PARTICULAR PROCEDURES

Article 61(2) provides: ‘In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except
as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection
with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and

expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of

the Centre shall be paid.’
This article goes on to specify that such decision ‘shall form part of the award’.°*!

Paragraph (1)(j) of Rule 47 of the Arbitration Rules,*” which regulates the award,
contains a general empowerment with respect to costs. It specifies that the award ‘shall’

contain ‘any decision of the Tribunal regarding the cost of the proceeding’.

Tribunals rely on Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention and the general power it
grants the Tribunal to allocate the costs of arbitral proceedings even in orders taking

note of discontinuance.
B. Case law

In 2010, the Tribunal in Quadrant Pacific v. Costa Rica decided that it had the power
to allocate costs in an order taking note of discontinuance under Regulation 14(3)(d)
of the Administrative and Financial Regulations and Article 51 of the Arbitration
Additional Facility Rules?°°

In that case, the Tribunal noted that ‘[i]t is not common practice [. . .] to include a
decision on costs in [an order taking note of discontinuance] since this decision is
normally included as part of an arbitral award. Indeed, because an order providing
for the discontinuance of the proceedings does not amount to an arbitral award, it is
appropriate for the parties to settle between themselves the costs incurred prior to the

discontinuance’.*

After noting that the parties had failed to agree on how the costs of the proceedings
should be apportioned, the Tribunal stated that it ‘must decide whether it has the
authority to issue a decision on costs [in the order taking note of the discontinuance]

and, in this case, whether it should issue such an order’.°®

361 ICSID Convention, Article 61(2).

Tribunal regarding the cost of the proceeding.’

RULE 45 — DISCONTINUANCE FOR FAILURE OF PARTIES TO ACT

To conclude that it had the authority to issue a decision on costs, relying on Article
58(1) of the Arbitration Additional Facility Rules, the Tribunal stated that ‘an arbitral
tribunal has the authority and discretion, “[u]nless the parties otherwise agree,” to
decide the question of costs. There is no “agreement otherwise” in this case, the parties
having failed to negotiate the division of costs in this arbitral proceeding, and nothing
in the rules governing this proceeding preclude the Tribunal from deciding on the

allocation of the advance payments and costs of this truncated proceeding’ °*”

The Tribunal stated that it ‘may proceed to a decision on the allocation of costs on
the basis of other factors, such in a case where a party’s bad faith, lack of cooperation,
dilatory or otherwise improper conduct justifies that the costs of the proceedings be

assessed against such party. The tribunal thinks this is such a case’.*°”

The Tribunal found that the claimants should bear responsibility for the respondent’s
costs due to the particular circumstances of that case where ‘[a]fter almost two years of
adjudication and on the eve of the hearing on the merits, Claimants suddenly decided
to abandon their claims’.** Indeed, the Tribunal decided that ‘Claimants cannot expect
Respondent to carry the burden of the costs of defending claims that Claimants
decided to abandon’.“” The Tribunal thus concluded that in that case, ‘equity and
fairness mandate that Claimants should bear the expenses and costs incurred by the

Respondent in [the] arbitration’ +”

A few months later, the Tribunal in Piero Foresti v. South Africa*” followed the same
approach.

In that case, the question of whether the Tribunal had the power to make an order for
costs did not arise as its decision took the form of an award. However, when deciding
that it was ‘a fair and reasonable exercise of its discretion to require the Claimant to
make a contribution to the costs incurred by the Respondent’, the Tribunal explained
that ‘while claimants in investment arbitrations are in principle entitled to the costs
necessarily incurred in the vindication of their legal rights, they cannot expect to leave
respondent States to carry the costs of defending claims that are abandoned’3”

Chapter 25 PARTICULAR PROCEDURES

In 2011, the ad hoc Committee in RSM v. Granada*”™ ordered the discontinuance of
the proceeding under Regulation 14(3)(d). The ad oc Committee affirmed that it ‘is
conscious of the fact that orders for costs are not normally made on the discontinuance of
proceedings. Nonetheless [. . .] the Committee considers that it is appropriate to render
a Decision awarding the Respondent its fees and expenses incurred in connection with

these annulment proceedings, in view of the exceptional circumstances of this case’.*”4

In RSM v. Granada, the ‘exceptional circumstances’ were considered in light of ‘the
Applicant’s approach to the [.. .] proceeding’.*” Indeed, the Committee considered
that ‘the Applicant effectively abandoned the annulment proceeding once it had
launched its claim against Respondent under the Grenada-United States BIT (which,
the Committee observes, was rejected by the Tribunal in that separate proceeding as
being “manifestly without legal merit” within the meaning of Rule 41(5) of the ICSID
Arbitration Rules [...])’.3”

Expressing its agreement with the view expressed in Quadrant Pacific v. Costa Rica and
Piero Foresti v. South Africa, according to which claimants in investment arbitrations
cannot expect to leave it to States to carry the costs of abandoned claims, the ad hoc

Committee ordered the applicant to pay the respondent’s costs.*””

In ATA v. Jordan, the Tribunal, while stating that a decision on costs ‘is normally taken in
an award, as specified in Article 61(2) of the Convention,*” also recognised the power
for the Tribunal to allocate costs under Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention in an
order noting discontinuance pursuant to Rule 44.°” In that case, the ad oc Committee

further noted that both parties to the arbitration asked it to proceed this way.**°

In that case, the ad foc Committee went on to state that it had broad discretion in
determining costs but that ‘discretion may not be capricious or arbitrary. It must be the

result of rational consideration of relevant factors’.**' The Tribunal also noted that ‘there

is no general rule applicable to allocation of costs in cases of discontinuance on the

request of a party. The decision must be taken on a case by case basis’.**”

In that case, the parties had a serious divergence as to the meaning of the award rendered.
The respondent State therefore submitted to the Tribunal a request for interpretation.
The respondent was convinced that if the claimant’s interpretation was retained by the
Tribunal, there would be serious grounds for annulment of the award. Pending the
Tribunal’s decision on interpretation, the respondent State applied for annulment of the
award. When the Tribunal rendered its decision on interpretation, which rejected the
claimant’s interpretation, the respondent State withdrew its application for annulment
of the award.

Whilst the parties were in agreement with regard to the discontinuance of the
annulment proceeding pursuant to Rule 44, they disagreed with respect to the allocation
of costs. Indeed, the applicant in the annulment proceeding’s requested that the ad
hoc Committee direct the respondent to the annulment proceeding to pay its costs, to
which the later ‘strongly’ objected.

Faced with the applicant in the annulment proceeding’s request, the ad hoc Committee,
concluded that it ‘faill[ed] to see any abuse of rights in [the applicant in the annulment
proceeding’s/respondent State’s] actions and therefore [saw] no reason to direct the
Applicant to pay all the costs in th[e annulment proceeding]’.*** The ad oc Committee
therefore ordered the respondent to the annulment proceeding to pay an amount to the
applicant in the annulment proceeding in respect of the fees and costs claimed by the

applicant.

The most recent publicly available order taking note of discontinuance dated 14
December 2015, concerning allocation of costs in discontinuance proceedings, was

rendered in Giovanni Alemanni v. Argentine Republic.

In that case, the Tribunal discontinued the proceeding pursuant to Regulation 14(3)(d)
of the ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulations.

Chapter 25 PARTICULAR PROCEDURES

While the Tribunal agreed ‘as a matter of principle’ with the ‘growing tendency’ on
the part of Tribunals to allocate costs in an order according to the general powers
conferred to them,**” indeed ‘the idea should never be allowed to gain ground that
launching claims, or maintaining defences, that turn out to be unsustainable is a cost-
free option’** the Tribunal decided that ‘it d[id] not possess the power to make the
costs orders applied for either [side in the arbitration]. Even if it had found itself to
have a power of that kind, the Tribunal is in serious doubt whether it would, in the

circumstances of the case, have wished to exercise it’.**?

The Tribunal highlighted ‘the failings in co-operation between the Parties and with the
Tribunal?” and noted that ‘the Tribunal ha[d] no way of knowing whether the proceeds
of any costs award would have found their way into the pockets of the Claimants

themselves or the litigation funders’.*”"

Therefore, it seems that the Tribunal’s refusal to follow the general tendency to allocate
costs in an order taking note of discontinuance may be explained by the very specific

circumstances of the case involving failings in co-operation between the parties and
with the Tribunal.3”

However, this case does not seem to counter the general tendency for tribunals to
recognise their power to allocate costs in orders taking note of discontinuance and their

exercise of such power as warranted by each particular case.
