Constitutive Instruments and Procedural Rules

I Introduction

This chapter serves as an introduction to provisional measures within the
postwar system of international dispute resolution. More particularly, it
seeks to introduce the constitutive instruments and procedural rules — as
well as their drafting history, context and content — that enable the award
of interim relief by international courts and tribunals. It also serves to
introduce those international courts and tribunals the practice of which
will be analyzed in Part IH, namely: (a) the ICJ; (b) dispute settlement
bodies operating under UNCLOS Part XV, i.e. ITLOS and arbitration
tribunals governed by UNCLOS Annex VII; (c) investor-state arbitration
tribunals applying the ICSID Convention and associated instruments;
and (d) various inter-state and investor-state arbitration tribunals that
apply either the 1976 or 2010 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules or some
variant thereof.

II The International Court of Justice
A Succeeding the Permanent Court of International Justice

The ICJ is the only permanent international tribunal of plenary subject-
matter jurisdiction. Its history is very much as a continuation of its pre-
decessor, the PCIJ. Closed for business! following its 1939 determination
in Electricity Company’ and with its third general election of judges sus-
pended indefinitely,’ the PCIJ was obsolete before it was formally wound
up in 1946. However, the migration of President Guerrero and the Reg-
istry to Geneva, and the continued presence of Judge van Eysinga in The

Hague, ensured that the archives and institutional architecture of the
Court remained intact.* Accordingly, the stage was set in 1945 for a new
institution to take up its mandate.°

Suggestions for the establishment of a new world court first arose in
November 1942, with the publication of a preliminary recommendation
of the Inter-American Juridical Committee by the Governing Board of
the Pan-American Union. This included the suggestion that:

The jurisdiction of the Permanent Court of International Justice be
extended, and procedure before the Court should be coordinated with
that of regional judicial tribunals, if any should be created; the jurisdic-
tion of these regional tribunals being determined by the place and subject
matter of the controversy.®

This was followed by a suggestion by the UK in 1943 that an informal
expert committee be established to consider the future of the PCIJ.’ The
resulting Inter-Allied Committee held 19 meetings throughout 1943 and
1944, and produced a final report concluding that the PCIJ Statute had,
on the whole ‘worked well’ and that it was ‘desirable to make full use
of an existing structure which has proved well adapted for its purpose’.
Accordingly, it was recommended that any successor institution adopt a
similar general structure.®

The first serious preliminaries for the establishment of a successor
to the PCI arose in the so-called ‘Dumbarton Oaks’ Proposals for the
Establishment of a General International Organization. These arose from
informal discussions between several of the Allied powers’ and were

published on 9 October 1944. The Proposals identified the need for an
international court ‘which should constitute the principal judicial organ
of the Organization, and further suggested in Chapter VU, paragraph 3
that:

The statute of the court of international justice should be either (a) the
Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice, continued in force
with such modifications as may be desirable, or (b) a new statute in the
preparation of which the Statute of the Permanent Court of International
Justice should be used as a basis.'°

The balance of the Dumbarton Oaks Proposals concerning the proposed
‘international court of justice’™ signaled a major constitutional change
in the way in which the institution would be viewed against the backdrop
of its parent organization.’” The court was to be considered one of the
principal organs of the Organization per Chapter IV, paragraph 1 of the
Proposals,'° and all members of the Organization were to be ipso facto
parties to the court’s constituent instrument, per Chapter VII, paragraph
1.'4 This was a marked contrast to the model adopted by the PC] vis-a-vis
the League of Nations.'°

Following on from Dumbarton Oaks, the US, on behalf of the Spon-
soring Powers, convened a Committee of Jurists in Washington, DC, on
9 April 1945 in order to prepare a new draft statute. The work of the
Washington Committee may be seen as an extension of that of the Inter-
Allied Committee — it was not empowered to take definitive action, but
only to prepare a basis for formal negotiation at the UN Conference on
International Organization in San Francisco.'® As such, it did not take a
view on the central question of whether the PCIJ should be folded into
the UN system, or whether an entirely new successor institution should

be established — rather, the Committee simply acknowledged that on any
view Chapter VII, paragraph 3 of the Dumbarton Oaks Proposals estab-
lished that the PCIJ Statute was to be used as a basis for any future action,
and set about revising it,'’ producing a draft on 20 April 1945.'® As was
later noted at San Francisco, the draft adopted many provisions of the
preexisting Statute without modification, particularly those relating to
procedural questions.!”

At San Francisco, a decision was finally taken as to the form of the
proposed court. Committee 1 of Commission IV was charged with the
consideration of both Chapter VII of the Dumbarton Oaks Proposals
and the Draft Statute prepared by the Washington Commission.”° Sub-
Committee IV/1/A, in turn, examined the question of continuity of the
PCIJ and its attendant problems. In its final report of 21 May 1945,
the Sub-Committee recommended the creation of a new court and the
conclusion of a new statute, principally on the basis that this would be
the easiest way for the court to be integrated into the new Organization
without breaching accepted rules of international law vis-d-vis existing
members of the PCIJ Statute that might not wish to be parties to the UN
system.”! The Sub-Committee proposed the following additions to the
nascent Charter:

(1) A tribunal to be called the International Court of Justice is hereby
established as the principal judicial organ of the United Nations.

(2) The Court shall be constituted and shall function in accordance with
the annexed Statute which forms an integral part of the Charter of the
United Nations.

(3) Nothing in this Charter shall prevent the parties from entrusting the
solution of their differences to other Tribunals by virtue of agreements
already in existence or which may be concluded in the future.”

These suggestions were adopted by Committee [V/1, which presented
an expanded version thereof to Commission IV in its final report of

12 June 1945.”° This survives, substantially unchanged, in Articles 92-5
of the Charter. The Committee also submitted for adoption a further draft
statute, which followed the approach of the Washington Committee in
carrying over without any more than cosmetic amendment the procedural
provisions of the PCYJ Statute. Following further discussion, the draft was
unanimously approved by Commission IV,”* and incorporated into the
Charter itself.?°

Following San Francisco all that was left was for the ICJ to displace its
predecessor.*° The PCIJ, having not met since 1940, held its final session
in The Hague at the end of October 1945, adopting two resolutions on the
measures to be taken to preserve the continuity of international justice.”
The judges of the PCIJ then tendered their resignations to the Secretary-
General of the League through President Guerrero on 31 January 1946,
prior to the first elections for the ICJ on 6 February 1946. On 18 April
1946, the Assembly of the League, adopting a report of its First Committee,
dissolved the PCIJ.”8 Its successor held its inaugural session on the same
day, with Guerrero sitting as its first President.

B_ Article 41 of the IC] Statute

Article 41 of the PCIJ Statute fell into that group of provisions that the
Washington Committee considered to be purely procedural, and thus not
requiring drastic amendment. The only proposed alterations were (a) the
correction of the printer’s error ‘preserve’ in place of ‘reserve’, (b) the
insertion of the word ‘Security’ in front of ‘Council’ and (c) the renum-
bering of the resultant paragraphs.’? This amendment was approved —
by way of an en bloc vote concerning Articles 40-43 of the Washington
Committee’s draft — without objection.*° Article 41 proved similarly
uncontroversial at San Francisco, with Committee [V/1 approving Arti-
cles 39-64 of the Washington Committee’s draft without discussion.°!

the English and French versions of the text are not in total harmony”?
the provision remains unchanged:

(1) The Court shall have the power to indicate, if it considers that circum-
stances so require, any provisional measures which ought to be taken
to preserve the respective rights of either party.

(2) Pending the final decision, notice of the measures suggested shall
forthwith be given to the parties and to the Security Council.

As such, there is little to be said about Article 41 of the ICJ Statute that
has not already been said in relation to the drafting of its predecessor.**
What may be noted, however, is that the ICJ also considered itself to
have inherited the PCI)’s jurisprudence, reflected in the use of the latter’s
jurisprudence by parties appearing before the former, and indeed by the
Court itself*° — as noted by the dissenting Judge Read in the Peace Treaties
advisory opinion, Article 92 of the Charter permits no doubt that:

[T]he United Nations intended continuity in jurisprudence, as well as in
less important matters. While this does not make the decisions of the
Permanent Court binding, in the sense in which decisions may be binding
in common-law countries, it does make it necessary to treat them with the
utmost respect, and to follow them unless there are compelling reasons
for rejecting their authority.*©

In the specific context of provisional measures, this point was made clear
early on in the Anglo-Iranian Oil case, the ICJ’s first consideration of
the question of provisional measures. In a dissenting opinion, Judges
Winiarski and Badawi Pasha dismissed the decisions of the inter-war
mixed arbitral tribunals, saying ‘there is [ ... ] nothing to be learned from

Similarly, Judge Lauterpacht in Interhandel referred to the Polish Agrarian
Reform case with approval,°> and mention was made of numerous
other Permanent Court decisions by individual judges in Aegean Sea.°?
Insofar as majority opinions are concerned, hints of continuity with
the jurisprudence of the Permanent Court appeared in the unanimous
decision on provisional measures in Tehran Hostages, in which the
Chorzéw Factory (Indemnities) case was distinguished.*° The relevant
connection was only made clear in a positive sense, however, by the
Chamber in Burkina Faso/Mali,*' which referred with approval to the
South-Eastern Greenland case.

C Provisional Measures and the IC] Rules

1 The 1946 and 1972 Rules

As discussed in Chapter 2, Article 41 of the ICJ Statute, like its predecessor,
is skeletal — a ‘sparse, axiomatic statement’” that has resulted in a law of
provisional measures that is largely judge-made. Certain elements of this
law — those relating to its procedural operation — have been codified by
the Court in its Rules. Whilst Article 57 of the PCIJ’s 1922 Rules was very
sparse indeed, Article 57 of the 1931 Rules and Article 61 of its 1936 Rules
reveal the growing complexity of the Court’s jurisprudence on interim
relief, as well as the extent of its self-defined power to intervene.”
Article 61 of the 1936 Rules provided the basis on which the ICJ was to
proceed with respect to provisional measures in 1946. At its first session,
the Court proceeded to draft its new rules of procedure,“ and referred to
the 1936 Rules for that purpose.” Article 61 was replicated in its entirety,
but for paragraph (9), which permitted the attendance of judges ad hoc
in provisional measures hearings ‘if their presence can be assured by the

date fixed by the President for hearing of the parties. Such a provision
was unnecessary in an age of modern air travel,*° and judges ad hoc have
since then held an unrestricted right to sit on applications for interim
relief.

The adoption of the 1936 Rules in 1946 was intended to give the Court
the procedural space to conduct a more thorough revision. However,
although the matter remained subject to continuous review, the Rules
were not revisited at length until 1972.4” Even then, the revision was
piecemeal — the Court had initiated a full review of the Rules in 1967, but
ultimately abandoned this in favour of the more modest reworking that
appeared in 1972.*° Aside from being renumbered as Article 66, Article
61 of the 1946 Rules remained untouched by the amendments.

2 The 1978 Rules

Following its regular elections in February 1973 the Court returned to the
question of the Rules, eventually approving the long-awaited complete
revision in 1978,*? which remains current.°? The process of revision,
moreover, took particular account of the law of provisional measures.
Article 66 of the 1972 Rules became Articles 73-8, six provisions housed
within Part III (Proceedings in Contentious Cases), Section D (Incidental
Proceedings), Subsection 1 (Interim Protection) of the 1978 Rules. Again,
the Court through this revision sought to codify within these articles its
practice regarding provisional measures.°! Although only one request for
interim relief — Electricity Company — had been heard under the 1936
Rules, the Court had occasion to apply its model on multiple occasions

90 CONSTITUTIVE INSTRUMENTS AND PROCEDURAL RULES

between 1946 and 1978, leading to a wealth of new experience that largely
reinforced the old.°* The provisions are as follows:

Article 73

(1) A written request for the indication of provisional measures may be
made by a party at any time during the course of the proceedings in
the case in connection with which the request is made.

(2) Arequest shall specify the reasons therefore, the possible consequences
if it is not granted, and the measures requested. A certified copy shall
forthwith be transmitted by the Registrar to the other party.

Article 74

(1) A request for the indication of provisional measures shall have priority
over all other cases.

(2) The Court, if it is not sitting when the request is made, shall be
convened forthwith for the purpose of proceeding to a decision on
the request as a matter of urgency.

(3) The Court, or the President if the Court is not sitting, shall fix a
date for a hearing which will afford the parties an opportunity of
being represented at it. The Court shall receive and take into account
any observations that may be presented to it before the close of oral
proceedings.

(4) Pending a meeting of the Court, the President may call upon the
parties to act in such a way as will enable any order the Court may
make on the request for provisional measures to have its appropriate
effect.

Article 75

(1) The Court may at any time decide to examine proprio motu whether
the circumstances of the case require the indication of provisional
measures which ought to be taken or complied with by any or all of
the parties.

(2) When a request for provisional measures has been made, the Court
may indicate measures that are in whole or in part other than those
requested or that ought to be taken or complied with by the party
which has itself made the request.

THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE 91

(3) The rejection of a request for the indication of provisional measures
shall not prevent the party which made it from making a fresh request
in the same case based on new facts.

Article 76

(1) At the request of a party the Court may, at any time before the final
judgment in the case, revoke or modify any decision concerning provi-
sional measures if, in its opinion, some change in the situation justifies
such revocation or modification.

(2) Anapplication bya party proposing such a revocation or modification
shall specify the change in circumstances considered to be relevant.

(3) Before taking any decision under paragraph 1 of this Article the Court
shall afford the parties an opportunity of presenting their observations
on the subject.

Article 77 Any measures indicated by the Court under Articles 73 and
75 of these Rules, and any decision taken by the Court under Article

76, paragraph 1, of these Rules, shall forthwith be communicated to the
Secretary-General of the United Nations for transmission to the Security
Council in pursuance of Article 41, paragraph 2, of the Statute.

Article 78 The Court may request information from the parties on any
matter connected with the implementation of any provisional measures it

has indicated.

Articles 73-78 of the 1978 Rules do not do much more than articu-
late the capacity of the Court to award provisional measures. Article 73
describes the form that the application should take, as well as the time at
which an application may be made, expanding on Article 66(1) of the 1972
Rules and its predecessors. Article 74 replicates paragraphs (2) and (3) of
the same, with Article 74(3) preserving the long-standing preference of
the Court that both parties be given the opportunity to express a view
on an application for interim relief — although this may be abandoned in
extreme circumstances, e.g. LaGrand, where provisional measures were
awarded ex parte on the basis of Germany’s submissions alone.”

Article 74(4) recasts slightly Article 66(3) of the 1972 Rules, concerning
the capacity of the President ‘to take such measures as may appear to
him to be necessary in order to enable the Court to give an effective
decision’ pending the Court’s composition.” This expansion is based on

the actions of President Adatci in the Prince von Pless case’’ and President
Basdevant in Anglo-Iranian Oil.°° However, despite the change in wording,
subsequent invocations of the power by the President do not exhibit a
different timbre — in essence, all that the President is empowered to do
is correspond with the parties and recommend that measures resembling
an official declaration of interim relief be taken pending further judicial
action. In Tehran Hostages, for example, President Waldock sent through
the Registry a (conspicuously ineffective) telegram to the parties invoking
Article 74(4), noting that the matter was sub iudice and requesting that
any decision by the Court on interim relief ‘have its appropriate effects’.””
More recently, appeals to act so as to not prejudice the ability of the
Court to award effective interim relief were made by Acting President
Weeramantry in the Breard’® and LaGrand”? cases, though he did not
(perhaps curiously) do so in Avena.

Articles 75(1) and (2) of the 1978 Rules reserve respectively the power
of the Court to award provisional measures other than those indicated in
the request and to, moreover, do so proprio motu—an authority present in
Articles 66(4) and (6) of the 1972 Rules and its predecessors and which is
exercised not infrequently. Article 75(3), in turn, replicates Article 66(5)
of the earlier Rules, enabling the bringing of a new request for provisional
measures based on fresh facts in the event of a rejection of the initial
request. Parties before the Court have historically not been minded to
make new requests in the face of a rejection. They have, however, availed
themselves of Article 76 (based on Article 66(7) of the 1972 Rules), which
permits the revocation or modification of any extant order on provisional
measures based on a change in the underlying situation. The provision
is based on the jurisprudence of the Fisheries Jurisdiction cases regarding

the continuation of provisional measures.©? The Court clearly considers
Articles 75(3) and 76 to be based on allied considerations (i.e. material
additions to the factual matrix) and thus operating in a similar fashion.°!
However, despite multiple requests under Article 76, the Court has never
seen fit to revoke or modify an earlier award of interim relief.

Finally, Article 77 of the 1972 Rules gives form to Article 41(2) of the
Court’s Statute, and prescribes a procedure under which measures indi-
cated by the Court are communicated to the Security Council through
the Secretary-General. Article 78, in turn, comprises an additional power
to request information from the parties on the implementation of provi-
sional measures, and any further matter connected thereto, reproducing a
power first adduced by the Court in the two Fisheries Jurisdiction cases.©°

94 CONSTITUTIVE INSTRUMENTS AND PROCEDURAL RULES

(and likely definitive) in a series of attempts to codify the law of the sea
stretching back to the 1930 League of Nations Conference for the Codi-
fication of International Law.® This process encompassed not only a set
of ILC articles,©’ but the First and Second UN Conferences on the Law
of the Sea (UNCLOS I and II), resulting in the four Geneva Conventions
addressing various aspects of the field.

UNCLOS ITI was convened in part to address an area that had not been
covered by the earlier international conferences, viz. the exploration and
exploitation of the seabed in areas beyond national jurisdiction. Consid-
eration of the issue was prompted by a speech to the First Committee
of the General Assembly by the Maltese ambassador to the UN, Arvid
Pardo, in 1967,°’ which resulted in the creation of the Committee on the
Peaceful Uses of the Seabed.”” The Committee’s work, in turn, led to the
adoption of the 1970 Declaration of Deep Seabed Principles by the Gen-
eral Assembly.’! This document was not intended to be the final word on
the subject, but rather anticipated the establishment of an international
regime that would implement its contents.” To this end, adoption of the
Declaration was accompanied by a further resolution, convening UNC-
LOS III.” The Conference was not, however, limited to consideration of
the seabed, but was rather instructed to ‘adopt a convention dealing with
all matters relating to the law of the sea’.’”* What was intended, therefore,
was not a new Geneva Convention on seabed issues, but a comprehensive

convention negotiated according to three key principles, namely that the
convention: (1) be an exhaustive code for the law of the sea as a whole,
covering all legal issues in a single text; (2) attain the widest possible level
of participation by the international community and reflect a consensus
on the relevant law; and (3) be a ‘package deal’ which could only be
ratified fully, without reservations.”°

At the core of this ambitious brief was a system of compulsory dis-
pute resolution — ‘the cement [that would] hold the whole structure
together and guarantee its continued acceptability and endurance for all
parties’’° Such a system had previously been suggested by certain del-
egates at UNCLOS I, particularly in relation to the delimitation of the
then-novel continental shelf,’” but had been abandoned in the face of
concerted opposition.”® Dispute settlement was neglected early on in
UNCLOS IU, resulting in the creation of an informal working group to
consider the core issues and to develop potential models.” Four princi-
ples emerged as central to the proposed system, as summarized by the
delegation of El Salvador: (1) the settlement of disputes by legal, effective
means in order to avoid political and economic pressures; (2) the need
for uniformity in the interpretation of the proposed convention; (3) the
recognition of the advantages offered by obligatory settlement of disputes,

Arising from the Law of the Sea Conventions, 29 April 1958, 450 UNTS 170, referring
certain disagreements to the ICJ, but this was by its very nature non-compulsory, and
in any event was never relied as a basis for jurisdiction in any matter brought between
its conclusion in 1958 and the adoption of UNCLOS in 1982 — it was accordingly a
failure. Further: Natalie Klein, Dispute Settlement in the UN Convention on the Law of the

taking into account some exceptions which had to be determined with
the greatest care; and (4) the firm conviction that if the future convention
was to be signed and ratified, then the system of the settlement of disputes
must be an integral part and must constitute an essential element of that
convention.®° Thus, the El Salvadoran ambassador continued:

It was [...] assumed that the law was the most appropriate method of
regulating international relations and preserving the quality of States,
regardless of their political, economic and military might. That principle
of strict legality, which implied the effective application of agreed rules,
should be the principal element on which the future convention on the
law of the sea would be based.®!

At the Conference session in 1976, its President took the initiative to
include a section on dispute settlement in the Informal Single Negotiating
Text that was to serve as the basis for future discussions.** From here, the
issue was considered by the Conference as a whole, culminating in the
adoption of UNCLOS as a whole in 1982.°° It included, in Part XV, an
extensive regime of compulsory dispute settlement.

2 Dispute Settlement Architecture Under UNCLOS

A brief explanation of the system of dispute settlement contained within
UNCLOS is now desirable.** As stated, the core of the system is con-
tained within Part XV (Settlement of Disputes) of the Convention, Section
1 (General Provisions) of which establishs certain thematic parameters.
Parties are under an obligation to settle disputes via peaceful means® and
are not prevented from settling disputes via means other than those pro-
vided for in the Convention.*° Where a dispute arises between parties
concerning the interpretation or application of UNCLOS, they are under
an obligation to proceed expeditiously to an exchange of views regarding
its settlement by negotiation or other peaceful means.°*”

Section 2 (Compulsory Procedures Entailing Binding Decisions) acts
as the entry point to the UNCLOS dispute settlement system. Article
287(1) provides that a state becoming a party to UNCLOS may choose by

written declaration to have one of four tribunals determine disputes con-
cerning the interpretation or application of the Convention.®® The most
significant of these — within the UNCLOS system at least — is ITLOS, a
permanent international tribunal established by Annex VI of the Conven-
tion and charged by Article 21 thereof with jurisdiction over all disputes
and applications submitted in accordance with UNCLOS and all matters
specifically provided for in other agreements which confer jurisdiction
upon it, e.g. the Straddling Stocks Agreement.® In terms of organiza-
tion and procedure, the resulting body is similar to the ICJ. Special
provision is also made for a Seabed Disputes Chamber with jurisdic-
tion over disputes concerning certain activities occurring in areas of
the seabed beyond national jurisdiction.”” Subject to the agreement of
the parties, ITLOS is also capable of creating special chambers for the
hearing of a particular dispute.?! Also significant is UNCLOS Annex
VII, which provides for the creation of ad hoc arbitral tribunals to hear
inter-state disputes, as well those disputes involving international orga-
nizations, e.g. the European Community.?* UNCLOS Annex VIII pro-
vides for so-called ‘special’ arbitration with respect to certain technical
areas, and was inserted during UNCLOS III as a concession to the Soviet
states, which wanted a greater degree of control over the composition
of arbitral tribunals through the selection of expert members.”? It has,
however, proved to be something of a dead letter, and has never been
used.

98 CONSTITUTIVE INSTRUMENTS AND PROCEDURAL RULES

The ‘compulsory’ nature of Part XV dispute settlement is established,
prima facie, by UNCLOS Article 286, which compels the application of the
regime where any alternative means of resolution chosen by the parties has
failed. There are, however, certain exceptions per Section 3 (Limitations
and Exceptions to Applicability of Section 2).?* Disputes concerning the
exercise by a coastal state of sovereign rights or jurisdiction provided for in
the Convention shall not be subject to compulsory dispute settlement save
in certain specified circumstances.” Certain additional limitations also
apply to a state’s refusal to give permission for marine scientific research
to be conducted on its continental shelf or in its exclusive economic zone
(EEZ).”© A similar regime exists with respect to certain EEZ fisheries
disputes.?” UNCLOS also permits a state to opt out of the compulsory
regime with respect to disputes concerning: (a) delimitation and claims
to historic waters; (b) military and law enforcement activities; and (c)
matters of which the Security Council is seized.”®

B UNCLOS Article 290

Provisional measures within the UNCLOS system of dispute resolution
are regulated principally by Article 290. The ICJ had been in operation
for some 35 years prior to the conclusion of UNCLOS and had as a result
established itself as the dominant model for the granting of provisional
measures in international disputes. Consequently, it is unsurprising that
the delegates to the UNCLOS II turned to Article 41 of the IC] Statute
when seeking to define the scope for provisional measures within the
dispute resolution provisions of UNCLOS. The informal working group,
however, departed from the wording of Article 41, on the basis that, inter
alia, the word ‘indicate’ as used in the provision did not clearly convey the
binding nature of provisional measures.”? A further consideration that
emerged over the course of UNCLOS II was how to adapt the precedent
set by the ICJ to the scheme of dispute resolution contained in UNCLOS
Part XV, which as said permits parties to submit disputes concerning the
interpretation or application to a number of different forums. The result
is a somewhat lengthy provision available to all courts and tribunals that
have jurisdiction under UNCLOS:!°

DISPUTE SETTLEMENT UNDER UNCLOS 99

(1) If a dispute has been duly submitted to a court or tribunal which
considers that prima facie it has jurisdiction under this Part or Part
XI, section 5, the court or tribunal may prescribe any provisional
measures which it considers appropriate under the circumstances
to preserve the respective rights of the parties to the dispute or to
prevent serious harm to the marine environment, pending the final
decision.

(2) Provisional measures may be modified or revoked as soon as the
circumstances justifying them have changed or ceased to exist.

(3) Provisional measures may be prescribed, modified or revoked under
this article only at the request of a party to the dispute and after the
parties have been given an opportunity to be heard.

(4) The court or tribunal shall forthwith give notice to the parties to
the dispute, and to such other States Parties as it considers appro-
priate, of the prescription, modification or revocation of provisional
measures.

(5) Pending the constitution of an arbitral tribunal to which a dispute
is being submitted under this section, any court or tribunal agreed
upon by the parties or, failing such agreement within two weeks from
the date of the request for provisional measures, the International
Tribunal for the Law of the Sea or, with respect to activities in the
Area, the Seabed Disputes Chamber, may prescribe, modify or revoke
provisional measures in accordance with this article if it considers
that prima facie the tribunal which is to be constituted would have
jurisdiction and that the urgency of the situation so requires. Once
constituted, the tribunal to which the dispute has been submitted
may modify, revoke or affirm those provisional measures, acting in
conformity with paragraphs 1 to 4.

(6) The parties to the dispute shall comply promptly with any provisional
measures prescribed under this article.

Although more complicated than Article 41 of the Statute, UNCLOS
Article 290 is still clearly descended from it. Its complexity in part derives
from a desire on the part of UNCLOS III to codify the practice of the
ICJ and to avoid those areas of uncertainty thrown up by the Court’s
jurisprudence since 1947. In the first place, both Articles 290(1) and (5)
make reference to the need for the court or tribunal seized to establish

Transnational, 1987) 179 avers to the potential that the use of UNCLOS Art 290 could
‘harmonize’ the practice of the ICJ with respect to provisional measures. This has not
come to pass. Under UNCLOS Art 287(5), if the parties elect different methods of dispute
resolution, the matter is to be referred to Annex VII arbitration, which together with a
relatively low number of states selecting the ICJ under UNCLOS Art 287(1) has led to a
situation in which the Court has never considered a referred matter.

its jurisdiction on a prima facie basis prior to the granting of provisional
measures, a point not mentioned expressly in Article 41 and which had
generated considerable controversy in the Anglo-Iranian Oilcase.'°' In the
second, Article 290(6) clearly provides for the automatic binding effect
of provisional measures on the parties, thereby forestalling a debate that
was still very much alive in relation to the ICJ in 1982.!°° The bind-
ing nature of provisional measures under Article 290 is also reflected
in the wording of paragraphs (1), (3), (4), (5) and (6), which refer
to the ‘prescription’ of provisional measures, rather than their ‘indica-
tion’. Finally, Article 290(1) is phrased in similar terms to Article 41
of the IC) Statute in that it describes the purpose of provisional mea-
sures as being to ‘preserve the respective rights of the parties to the
dispute’!

Two further features of Article 290 may be pointed out. Firstly, the
provision broadens the rights with respect to which provisional measures
may be ordered to include measures designed to ‘prevent serious harm
to the marine environment’ in paragraph (1). Thus, interim relief may
be ordered not in relation to rights under dispute, but ‘mainly or even
solely’ to prevent harm to the environment.’ Secondly, Article 290(5)
provides that, absent contrary agreement by the parties, ITLOS (or its
Seabed Disputes Chamber as required) may order provisional measures
pending the constitution of an Annex VII or VIII tribunal. The capacity
to order interim relief on behalf of another court or tribunal is one that
is not usually available to international adjudicative bodies,!” and may
be seen to raise particular issues of legitimacy when utilized.'° Lastly,
it should be noted that Article 31 of the Straddling Stocks Agreement,

C Provisional Measures and the Procedural Rules of UNCLOS Part
XV Dispute Settlement Bodies

1 The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea

Article 16 of UNCLOS Annex VI gives ITLOS the capacity to develop
its own rules, and in this capacity the Tribunal has seen fit to produce
and continually revise its procedure since the first meeting of its judges
in 1996. The first version of the ITLOS Rules'®® was based on the Final
Draft Rules prepared by the UNCLOS Preparatory Commission.!° These,
in turn, were based on the ICJ Rules — the only appropriate precedent
available — although as with UNCLOS Article 290, certain amendments
were required to accommodate the Tribunal’s multifaceted jurisdiction.'!”
As a result, the provisions of the ITLOS Rules as they relate to interim
relief are substantially similar to those of the ICJ Rules — a situation that
was not altered by the further amendment of the ITLOS Rules and their
republication in 2005.'!' The relevant provisions are contained in Part III
(Procedure), Section C (Incidental Proceedings), Subsection 1 (Provisional
Measures):!'?

107 The article provides:

(1) Pending the settlement of a dispute in accordance with [Part VII of the Agree-
ment], the parties to the dispute shall make every effort to enter into provisional
arrangements of a practical nature.

(2) Without prejudice to [UNCLOS Art 290], the court or tribunal to which the dispute
has been submitted under [Part VII] may prescribe any provisional measures which
it considers appropriate under the circumstances to preserve the respective rights of
the parties to the dispute or to prevent damage to the stocks in question, as well as
in the circumstances referred to in article 7, paragraph 5 and article 16, paragraph 2.

(3) A State Party to this Agreement which is not a Party to [UNCLOS] may declare that,
notwithstanding [UNCLOS Art 290(5)], [ITLOS] shall not be entitled to prescribe,
modify or revoke provisional measures without the agreement of such State.

(2) Pending the constitution of an arbitral tribunal to which a dispute
is being submitted, a party may submit a request for the prescrip-
tion of provisional measures under article 290, paragraph 5, of the
Convention:

(a) at any time if the parties have so agreed;

(b) at any time after two weeks from the notification to the other
party of a request for provisional measures if the parties have not
agreed that such measures may be prescribed by another court or
tribunal.

Article 91

(1) If the President of the Tribunal ascertains that at the date fixed for
the hearing referred to in article 90, paragraph 2, a sufficient number
of Members will not be available to constitute a quorum, the Cham-
ber of Summary Procedure shall be convened to carry out the func-
tions of the Tribunal with respect to the prescription of provisional
measures.

(2) The Tribunal shall review or revise provisional measures prescribed
by the Chamber of Summary Procedure at the written request of a
party within 15 days of the prescription of the measures. The Tribunal
may also at any time decide proprio motu to review or revise the
measures.

Article 92 The rejection of a request for the prescription of provisional
measures shall not prevent the party which made it from making a fresh

request in the same case based on new facts.

Article 93 A party may request the modification or revocation of pro-
visional measures. The request shall be submitted in writing and shall

specify the change in, or disappearance of, the circumstances considered
to be relevant. Before taking any decision on the request, the Tribunal shall
afford the parties an opportunity of presenting their observations on the
subject.

Article 94 Any provisional measures prescribed by the Tribunal or any
modification or revocation thereof shall forthwith be notified to the parties

and to such other States Parties as the Tribunal considers appropriate in
each case.

Article 95

(1) Each party shall inform the Tribunal as soon as possible as to its com-
pliance with any provisional measures the Tribunal has prescribed. In
particular, each party shall submit an initial report upon the steps it
has taken or proposes to take in order to ensure prompt compliance
with the measures prescribed.

(2) The Tribunal may request further information from the parties on
any matter connected with the implementation of any provisional
measures it has prescribed.

A reading of Articles 89-95 of the ITLOS Rules reveals an understanding
of the procedural power to award interim relief similar to that of the ICJ.
Under Article 89(5), the Tribunal is not required to mirror the content
of the initial request for provisional measures. The treatment of such
proceedings as urgent (subject to proceedings relating to prompt release)
is also preserved in Article 90(1), as is the capacity for the President to
enter into correspondence with the parties so as to recommend measures
that will render any interim relief effective under Article 90(4), although

AOVETSTEdT GST S.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press
104 CONSTITUTIVE INSTRUMENTS AND PROCEDURAL RULES

its only use to date has been by President Yanai in ARA Libertad.''* In the
event of a rejection, parties are able to issue a fresh request for provisional
measures based on additional facts per Article 92, and may also request
the modification or revocation of provisional measures per Article 93.
Finally, under Article 95, parties are required to report compliance with
provisional measures prescribed, and the Tribunal may request any further
information required.

There are, however, important differences between the ITLOS and ICJ
Rules.!' In the first place, the Tribunal is not empowered to engage in
initial consideration of interim relief proprio motu — although per Article
91(2) it has the capacity to renew or revise measures ordered at any time.
This reflects UNCLOS Article 290(3), according to which ‘[p]rovisional
measures may be prescribed, modified or revoked under this article only
at the request of a party to the dispute. This difference appears to be
driven by the fact that under UNCLOS Article 290(6), provisional mea-
sures awarded under this provision are considered binding,''® leading to
additional level of caution when awarding interim relief so as to forestall
any crisis of legitimacy.''” It is to be remembered that at the time at which
UNCLOS Article 290 and later the ITLOS Rules were drafted, the ICJ
had not yet determined whether its own provisional measures could be
considered binding. Since confirmation of this fact in LaGrand, the Court
has not amended its procedural rules. In the event of such an amendment,
however, it seems unlikely that its power to award interim relief proprio
motu would be restricted — the Court has long acknowledged its ability
to award provisional measures of its own volition and so long as this is
not abused, it is not prima facie inconsistent with the notion of such relief
being binding.

Another difference arises from Article 91(1) of the ITLOS Rules, which
provides for the composition of a Chamber of Summary Procedure in the
event that the President ascertains that on the date fixed for the hearing of
an application for interim relief, a quorum of Tribunal members will not
be present. Although the judges of ITLOS — unlike their ICJ counterparts —
are not expected to sit permanently, a situation has yet to arise in which
such a Chamber has been required, and the provision has lain dormant
accordingly.!'8

DISPUTE SETTLEMENT UNDER UNCLOS 105

The final substantial difference between ITLOS and the ICJ results
from the former’s capacity to award provisional measures on behalf of
an unconstituted Annex VII tribunal. Applications for such relief are
attended by specific procedural requirements in Article 89(4). The appli-
cant must not only indicate the legal grounds of the claim and basis of
the tribunal’s prima facie jurisdiction, but must provide evidence that the
proceedings in question have been instituted.

2 Annex VII Arbitration

Under Article 5 of UNCLOS Annex VII, Annex VII tribunals have the
capacity to determine their own procedure subject to the agreement of
the parties. As a matter of practice, tribunals have tended to adopt some
variation of the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules,'”” but these have proved lacking
in detail on the question of interim relief. For example, the procedural
rules adopted by the tribunals in Barbados/Trinidad and Tobago'*® and
ARA Libertad’?! make no reference to interim relief. In MOX Plant'”* and
Guyana v Suriname’*”’ the Procedural Rules were the subject of earlier
agreement between the parties, preventing the tribunals from adopting
their own procedure, but these too remain silent on the question.

This may be reflective of a deliberate decision on the part of Annex
VI tribunals and the parties appearing before them to avoid contradict-
ing UNCLOS Article 290, with the capacity of an Annex VII tribunal
to adopt its own procedure on provisional measures naturally subject
to this provision.'* Thus, such a tribunal would not be able to adopt
rules inconsistent with UNCLOS Article 290, e.g. rules providing that the
tribunal had the capacity to award interim relief proprio motu. This may
explain why the procedural rules adopted by Ireland and the UK before

IV International Investment Arbitration
A Treaty-Based Investor-State Arbitration

1 Bilateral and Multilateral Investment Treaties

It may fairly be said that the treaty-based system of investor-state arbi-
tration is now a prime mover in the practice of international courts
and tribunals.'*” Such arbitrations are conducted between a foreign
investor (which may be a natural or juridical person) and the ‘host’ state
in which its investment is located. Famously described by Paulsson as
‘arbitration without privity, '”® investor-state arbitration does not require
the intervention of the home state by way of diplomatic protection —
consequently, the system may be said to have hybrid foundations that do
not correspond directly with conventional notions of public or private
international law.'”?

The jurisdiction of an investor-state arbitral tribunal is usually estab-
lished by way of a bilateral investment treaty (BIT) concluded between
the host state and the ‘home’ state of the investor!*° — the first such
agreement was concluded between the Federal Republic of Germany and

be registered in writing, phrasing which has been interpreted to encompass contracts
between an investor and the host state (either prior to or following the emergence of the
dispute) and host state legislation in addition to bilateral and multilateral treaties: JCS7D

by a multilateral investment treaty concluded between more than two

UNCITRAL Rules.'** As a consequence, the instrument in question effec-
tively subordinates itself to an external process of dispute resolution. As
a general rule, this will include questions of interim relief. Exceptions
may, however, arise — it is possible for an investment treaty to include
some sui generis provisions on dispute settlement whilst still undertaking
an external reference. The chief example of this is NAFTA Chapter 11
(Investment), which sets out in Section B (Settlement of Disputes Between
a Party and an Investor of Another Party) detailed procedures for the
composition of an arbitral tribunal,'* governing law,'** and the giving
and enforcement of final awards.‘ It further includes, in Article 1134, a
provision on the granting of interim relief.!4° At the same time, however,
Article 1120(1) again provides for the submission of disputes to ICSID,
the ICSID Additional Facility or to ad hoc UNCITRAL arbitration. In
such cases and as provided for in Article 1120(2), the applicable arbitra-
tion procedures shall apply except to the extent modified by Chapter 11,
Section B. Such modifications will usually be drafted with the applicable
arbitration procedures in mind.

2 ICSID and the ICSID Convention

The ICSID Convention is one of the most common systems of arbitration
referred to by bilateral and multilateral investment treaties. The Con-
vention creates ICSID, an arbitral institution that provides logistical and
administrative support for investment disputes.'*” It is closely affiliated
with the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (more
commonly known as the World Bank) with the Bank’s board of executive
directors and its general counsel, Aron Broches, playing a key role in the
drafting and negotiation of the Convention.'*®

142 On distinctions between the options, see Stephen Jagusch and Jeffrey Sullivan, ‘A Com-
parison of ICSID and UNCITRAL Arbitration: Areas of Divergence and Concern, in M
Waibel et al., The Backlash Against Investment Arbitration: Perceptions and Reality (The
Hague: Kluwer, 2010); Judith Levine, “Navigating the parallel universe of investor-State

INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT ARBITRATION 109

Although investment treaty arbitration certainly existed prior to the
advent of the ICSID Convention,'” the Convention expanded and
systematized what had come before such that, as Elihu Lauterpacht
put it:

For the first time a system was instituted under which non-State entities —
corporations or individuals — could sue States directly; in which State
immunity was much restricted; under which international law could be
applied directly to the relationship between the investor and the host
State; in which the operation of the local remedies rule was excluded; and
in which the tribunal’s award would be directly enforceable within the
territories of the States parties.!°°

Notwithstanding the advantages of the ICSID system, investment arbitra-
tion pursuant to investment treaties did not become popular until 1990,
when the first BIT-based arbitration award was rendered.'*!

The ICSID Convention operates in addition to the requirements of an
investment treaty and so adds an additional layer of complexity to its
requirements — e.g. the relevant investor must satisfy the jurisdictional
requirements ratione personae and ratione materiae of both the treaty
and Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.'” Beyond this, the Convention
provides a comprehensive procedural framework for, inter alia, the com-
position of tribunals, the hearing of cases, the enforcement and challenge
of awards, and so forth — this includes the granting of interim relief where
required per Article 47 of the Convention. It is supported in this by the
ICSID Rules.

3 The ICSID Additional Facility

In 1974, the World Bank created the ICSID Additional Facility to extend
ICSID arbitration to certain disputes not covered by the ICSID Conven-
tion proper.'°? The Additional Facility applies where one of either the
home or host state of the relevant investment is not a member of the

(Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012). See further the 1965 Report of World Bank’s
Executive Directors, which acts as an introductory commentary to the Convention: 4 ILM
524,

ICSID Convention, and therefore outside its ambit.'** This is particularly
significant in the context of NAFTA, where the US and Canada are mem-
bers of the ICSID Convention, but Mexico is (presently) not.'°? As such,
NAFTA Article 1120(1)(b) provides for the referral of investment disputes
to the Additional Facility. Similarly, ECT Article 26(4)(a)(i1) enables the
use of the Additional Facility where necessary.

Where the Additional Facility is activated, the ICSID Convention does
not apply.'°° As such the Additional Facility utilizes a separate set of ICSID
Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules (ICSID (AF) Rules).!°’ The non-
applicability of the Convention deprives the parties of certain protections,
most notably Chapter IV (Arbitration), Sections 5 (Interpretation, Revision
and Annulment of the Award) and 6 (Recognition and Enforcement of
the Award). In such cases, annulment and enforcement will instead be
governed by the 1958 Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement
of Foreign Arbitral Awards'°® (New York Convention) and awards may
be subject to review by domestic courts.

B_ Treaty Provisions Governing Provisional Measures in International
Investment Law

1 Article 47 of the ICSID Convention

Article 47 of the ICSID Convention governs the award of provisional
measures by ICSID tribunals. It provides that:

Except as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal may, if it considers that
the circumstances so require, recommend any provisional measures which
should be taken to preserve the respective rights of either party.

The wording of Article 47 of the ICSID Convention is much more closely
referable to Article 41 of the Statute than UNCLOS Article 290, and
Article 41 indeed served as a model for the provision.'°? The fact,
however, that the text of Article 41 emerged from the ICSID draft-
ing process with what appears to be only minor alteration fails to
reflect its controversial character. Early drafts of the provision reveal
that much stronger wording was originally envisioned guaranteeing these
measures as binding and including a power to impose sanctions for

154 TCSID (AF), Art 2.

55 NAFTA Art 1120(1)(a) makes provision for reference to ICSID in the event that either
Mexico or Canada eventually join the ICSID Convention — Canada signed the Convention
in 2006 but did not ratify until 2013: icsid.worldbank.org/ICSID/Index.jsp.

non-compliance.'® These proposals encountered considerable opposi-
tion, and although a countervailing proposal to excise the provision
entirely was dropped,'*! the compromise position was a text that suf-
fered from the same ambiguity as Article 41, ie. in its use of the terms
‘recommend’ (similar in meaning to the term ‘indicate’ in Article 41)
and ‘should be taken’ when describing the grant of interim relief.‘ This
ambiguity was resolved in much the same way as in LaGrand by the tri-
bunal in Maffezini v Spain, which in 1999 declared that its authority ‘to
rule on provisional measures was no less binding than that of the final
award’.!©

In practical terms, Article 47 differs from the other provisions consid-
ered in that much of its early use was as a variant of anti-suit injunction,
used to restrain parallel proceedings in national courts.’ In this, the
experience of ICSID tribunals has been similar to that of the Iran—US
Claims Tribunal, which suffered from a similar problem.!® As will be
seen, this has modified how Article 47 is applied in modern proceedings.
A further difference arises in relation to the capacity of ICSID tribunals
to award provisional measures in circumstances where the jurisdiction
of the tribunal has not been definitively established. Unlike the ICJ and
dispute settlement under UNCLOS, ICSID contains a mechanism by
which a tribunal’s jurisdiction might be reviewed through the agency
of the Centre’s Secretary-General. Article 36(3) of the Convention pro-
vides that the Secretary-General shall register a request for arbitration
unless he or she finds that the dispute is manifestly outside the Centre’s
jurisdiction.!©

112 CONSTITUTIVE INSTRUMENTS AND PROCEDURAL RULES

2 NAFTA Article 1134

Although the initial stance taken in NAFTA negotiations was that Chap-
ter 11 tribunals not have the capacity to award interim relief,!®’ this posi-
tion was altered over the course of the discussions to reflect the approach
now taken in Article 1134. This provides that:

A Tribunal may order an interim measure of protection to preserve the
right of a disputing party, or to ensure that the Tribunal’s jurisdiction
is made fully effective, including an order to preserve evidence in the
possession or control of a disputing party and to protect the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction. A Tribunal may not order attachment or enjoin the applica-
tion of the measures alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article
1116 or 1117. For the purposes of this paragraph, an order includes a
recommendation.

Given the synergy between NAFTA Chapterl1 and ICSID dispute settle-
ment, it is unsurprising that Article 1134 was drafted with Article 47 of
the ICSID Convention in mind — notwithstanding that to date only the
Additional Facility has been utilized by Chapter 11 tribunals and thus
Article 47 has not been applied. When a NAFTA tribunal is composed
under the ICSID Convention, Article 1134 is deemed to modify the con-
tent of Article 47. It is broader than Article 47, expressly including the
power to award interim relief to ensure a NAFTA tribunal’s jurisdiction
remains fully effective, e.g. through orders for the protection of evi-
dence or the use of provisional measures protect jurisdictional exclusivity
over the merits.'®* In this, Article 1134 mirrors the practice of the early
ICSID tribunals, as well as that of the Iran—US Claims Tribunal.'©’ The
use of the word ‘including’ indicates that a NAFTA tribunal would not be
limited to only these two varieties of order; however, Article 1134 removes
some options from the tribunal, preventing orders for attachment (pro-
visional seizure) of property or the enjoining (provisional prohibition)
of measures purportedly contrary to NAFTA’s investment protections, a

167 Meg Kinnear et al, Investment Disputes under NAFTA: An Annotated Guide to Chapter 11
(Alphen aan den Rijn: Kluwer, 2006) 1134-1.

168 Earlier drafts of the provision made express mention of orders to preserve urisdic-
tional exclusivity’, but this language was eventually abandoned in favour of the current
formulation: ibid, 1134—1—-1134-2.

The shift in language, however, does not appear to confer ona NAFTA tribunal an exclusive
right to award interim relief once seized, and such a reading would appear to contradict
the waiver provision in NAFTA Art 1121, which permits a party to obtain injunctive,
declaratory or other extraordinary relief before municipal courts without compromising
the arbitral bargain: ibid, 1134-2. Cf. ICSID Rules, Rule 39(6); ICSID (AF) Rules, Art
46(4); 1976 UNCITRAL Rules, Art 26(3); 2010 UNCITRAL Rules, Art 26(9).

position consistent with the decision of the states parties in Article 1135 to
limit Chapter 11 relief to damages or the restitution at the election of the
claimant.'”° Indeed, in both the Pope & Talbot v Canada'”! and Feldman
v Mexico,'”* Chapter 11 tribunals operating under the Additional Facility
rejected applications for provisional measures on the basis that they called
for the enjoining of measures.

A final difference between NAFTA Article 1134 and Article 47 of the
ICSID Convention arises from the final sentence of the former which
states that an ‘order’ within the meaning of the provision includes a
‘recommendation’ This is a direct response to uncertainty at the time at
which NAFTA was drafted as to whether a ‘recommendation’ of interim
relief under Article 47 could be considered binding. The clause therefore
acts as a deeming provision to unequivocally affirm the obligatory nature
of provisional measures where a NAFTA tribunal is acting within the
ICSID system. However, since the decision by the ICSID tribunal in
Maffezini v Spain that Article 47 measures are binding and the adoption
of this position by many successor tribunals this element of NAFTA Article
1134 has largely lost its meaning.

C Provisional Measures Under the ICSID Rules and ICSID (AF) Rules
1 Rule 39 of the ICSID Rules

Since the conclusion of the ICSID Convention, several iterations of the
ICSID Rules have appeared, with the first set formally issued by the
Administrative Council in 1968.'”° In each of these, Rule 39 concerning
provisional measures has remained substantially unaltered, save for the
addition of two paragraphs. The Rule provides substantial guidance in
the award of interim relief by ICSID tribunals, and reads as follows:

(1) Atany time after the institution of the proceeding, a party may request
that provisional measures for the preservation of its right be recom-
mended by the Tribunal. The request shall specify the rights to be
preserved, the measures the recommendation of which is requested,
and the circumstances that require such measures.

(2) The Tribunal shall give priority to the consideration of a request made
pursuant to paragraph (1).

(3) The Tribunal may also recommend provisional measures on its own
initiative or recommend measures other than those specified in a
request. It may at any time modify or revoke its recommendations.

(4) The Tribunal shall only recommend provisional measures, or modify
or revoke its recommendations, after giving each party the opportu-
nity of presenting its observations.

(5) Ifa party makes a request pursuant to paragraph (1) before the consti-
tution of the Tribunal, the Secretary-General shall, on the application
of either party fix time limits for the parties to present observations on
the request, so that the request and observations may be considered
by the Tribunal promptly on its constitution.

(6) Nothing in this rule shall prevent the parties, provided they have so
stipulated in the agreement recording their consent, from requesting
any judicial or other authority to order provisional measures, prior to
or after the institution of the proceeding, for the preservation of their
respective rights and interests.

As with Article 47 of the ICSID Convention, Rule 39 is clearly referable
to the practice of the ICJ as it existed in the 1960s. Unlike the ICJ Rules,
however, the ICSID Rules (or at least Rule 39) have not undergone a com-
prehensive revision since they were first issued, and as such the precedent
reflected in Rule 39 is with some additions that of Article 61 the 1948 IC]
Rules, itself replicating Article 61 of the 1936 PCIJ Rules, and reflecting
an understanding of provisional measures that was extant at that time.
Rule 39(1) sets out the timing and content of an application for provi-
sional measures in a similar manner to Article 61(1), with Rule 39(2)
replicating Article 61(2) in giving priority to such applications over other
matters. Rule 39(3) gives a tribunal the capacity to award provisional
measures proprio motu and otherwise than in accordance with the appli-
cation, conflating thereby Articles 61(4) and (6). It also gives the tribunal
to the ability to modify or revoke measures as in Article 61(7). Rule 37(4),
in turn, prohibits the granting of interim relief completely ex parte in a
similar manner to Article 61(8).

Rules 37(5) and (6), however, reflect the sui generis character of the
ICSID system. Rule 37(6), added in 1984 as paragraph 5, concerns interim
measures issued by a municipal court. Unless the parties otherwise
provide (an unlikely outcome), the tribunal — even constituted — retains
exclusive jurisdiction over interim relief, an addition that reflects the
general exclusivity of ICSID arbitration per Article 26 of the ICSID

PSTS4T 9S 72.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press
INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT ARBITRATION 115

Convention.'”* Given the absence of a mechanism similar to UNCLOS
Article 290(5), the withholding of interim relief until composition of the
tribunal has the potential to permit damage to be done to the status quo,
and Rule 37(6) has been criticized accordingly.'”? Rule 39(5) was inserted
during the 2006 revision of the ICSID Rules in an effort to ameliorate this
situation and is intended to ensure that the tribunal is in a position to
consider the observations of both claimant and respondent immediately
on its constitution, !”° utilizing the office of the ICSID Secretary-General
to this effect.

2 Article 46 of the ICSID (AF) Rules

Within the Additional Facility, Article 46 (formerly Article 47!””) of the
ICSID (AF) Rules provides a streamlined version of Rule 39. It provides
as follows:

(1) Unless the arbitration agreement otherwise provides, either party
may at any time during the proceeding request that provisional
measures for the preservation of its rights be ordered by the Tri-
bunal. The Tribunal shall give priority to the consideration of such a
request.

(2) The Tribunal may also recommend provisional measures on its own
initiative or recommend measures other than those specified in a
request. It may at any time modify or revoke its recommendations.

(3) The Tribunal shall order or recommend provisional measures, or any
modification or revocation thereof, only after giving each party an
opportunity of presenting its observations.

(4) The parties may apply to any competent judicial authority for interim
or conservatory measures. By doing so, they shall not be held to
infringe the agreement to arbitrate or to affect the powers of the
Tribunal.

Paragraphs (1)—(3) of Article 46 are distilled from paragraphs (1)-(4)
of Rule 39 of the ICSID Rules, and preserve the conceptual core of a

tribunal’s power to award provisional measures, with one interesting
exception — under Article 46(1), a party may request that provisional
measures be ordered, but when acting pursuant to Article 46(2) so as
to award relief proprio motu or otherwise than in accordance with the
application, a tribunal may only recommend provisional measures. From
a purely linguistic standpoint, this would tend to indicate that Article
46(2) measures should not be considered binding, but the paragraph has
yet to be the subject of interpretation by a tribunal. However, given the
overt position taken by other ICSID tribunals in applying Article 47 of
the ICSID Convention, as well as the general trend of other international
courts and tribunals, it seems unlikely that a tribunal applying Article
46(2) would deem its efforts to be merely hortatory.

A more substantial difference lies in Article 46(4), which aban-
dons the exclusivity of interim relief seen in Rules 39(5) and (6).
This is similar in scope to the waiver provision of NAFTA Arti-
cle 1121, and allows a party to seek interim relief before munici-
pal court prior to (and indeed after) the composition of the arbitral
tribunal.

V_ Arbitral Tribunals and the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules
A Arbitration and International Dispute Settlement

1 The Permanent Court of Arbitration

Since the Alabama Claims arbitration of 1872,'”® states have regularly
resolved their differences via the use of arbitral tribunals, empowered
by treaty to resolve a particular dispute or category of disputes.!”? With
respect to inter-state arbitration in particular, these proceedings may be
administered by the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA),'®? which,
as is often said, is not permanent, is not a court and does not arbitrate.

ARBITRAL TRIBUNALS AND THE UNCITRAL ARBITRATION RULES 117

Like ICSID, the PCA is an arbitral institution, albeit one specifically con-
ceived to deal with inter-state matters, and was established by the 1899
Hague Convention on the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes.'*!
In hearing some 20 disputes between 1900 and 1932, the PCA was the
dominant forum for the resolution of international disputes — the advent
of the PCIJ, however, prompted some seven decades of hibernation, dur-
ing which time any inter-state arbitrations were largely resolved on an ad
hoc basis.'®?

Since 1981, however, the PCA has undergone something of a revival,
in part due to its willingness to administer UNCLOS Annex VII and
non-ICSID investor-state arbitrations, as well as a wide variety of other
international disputes.'®* This has led to a somewhat unlikely situation
in which the PCA has in the immediate past had, for the first time in the
joint history of the two bodies, more inter-state matters on its docket than
the IC].

2 International Claims and Compensation Bodies

Disputes arising from inter-state relations do not always endear them-
selves to a simple declaration of liability or non-liability, or to the award
of a single lump sum amount in damages — a single relationship or inci-
dent may result in a multitude of smaller claims. In such cases, states have
on occasion opted to establish ad hoc dispute resolution bodies for the
settlement of a suite of claims between states. As they are convened to
deal with a specific situation, the existence of such bodies may be pro-
longed. The first such body was established by the US and Great Britain
by the 1794 Jay Treaty for the resolution of certain boundary disputes
along the northeastern border between the US and Canada.'** A more
modern example is the Eritrea—Ethiopia Claims Commission,'®’ which

181. 29 July 1899, 187 CTS 410. This was amended in turn by the Convention on the Pacific
Settlement of International Disputes, 18 October 1907, 205 CTS 233.

In such cases, the facilities of the PCA were occasionally used, but its legal architecture
was largely neglected: Collier and Lowe, Settlement of Disputes, 36-7.

over nine years of operation determined a range of questions resulting
from the two-year armed conflict relating to the land border between the
two countries.

A related category of tribunal is that established to deal with mass
claims between states and the nationals of other states with respect to
a particular international situation. The most prominent of these is the
Iran—US Claims Tribunal, which was established following the 1979 Ira-
nian Revolution to deal with claims arising from the nationalization of
US-owned assets in Iran during the overthrow of the Shah.'®° Over the life
of the Tribunal, more than 3,800 cases have been filed, with the majority
now concluded.

3 Non-ICSID Investment Arbitration

Finally, some mention should be made outside of investor-state arbitra-
tion that occurs outside the ICSID system. In such cases, the sole instru-
ment for the composition of the tribunal and the hearing of the claim
is the investment treaty itself — the additional framework of the ICSID
Convention or the Additional Facility will not apply. Such matters may be
administered by an arbitral institution such as the PCA, the International
Chamber of Commerce (ICC) and others, or by no arbitral institution at
all. In both cases, however, enforcement of the award is guaranteed by the
New York Convention.

B The UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules

1 Drafting and Proliferation

The aforementioned forms of dispute resolution encompass a wide range
of international tribunals, many of them sui generis in character and with
no apparent common connection beyond being rooted generally in pub-
lic international law. Nonetheless, many of these bodies have adopted
or adapted a single set of procedural rules for their own use. Unlike the
other procedural rules considered in this chapter, the 1976 UNCITRAL
Arbitration Rules (UNCITRAL Rules) were not prepared with any par-
ticular tribunal or dispute in mind. Indeed, they were not even drafted
with a view to application in inter-state disputes, but were intended to

ARBITRAL TRIBUNALS AND THE UNCITRAL ARBITRATION RULES 119

apply to international commercial arbitration between natural or juridical
persons.

The UNCITRAL Rules developed as part of a wider evolution of an
effective and trustworthy system of international commercial arbitration
over the past six decades. This system is built upon three columns, with
UNCITRAL itself playing a central role in the evolution of all three.'®” The
first column is the New York Convention, which in essence allows private
parties to utilize the national courts of one country to implement arbitral
awards issued in another country. The second is the 1985 UNCITRAL
Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration'®® as amended in
2006.'®’ As its name suggests, this provides a model for a municipal
arbitration statute capable of producing an award compliant with the
New York Convention.!”? The third column is the UNCITRAL Rules
themselves.

The UNCITRAL Rules developed out of a review commissioned in the
wake of the successful conclusion of the New York Convention. At its sec-
ond session in 1969, UNCITRAL directed Ion Nestor of Romania to act as
Special Rapporteur to prepare a report on significant issues arising from
the application and interpretation of instruments concerning interna-
tional commercial arbitration.'?! Nestor duly prepared an interim report
in 1970! and a final report in 1972,’ in which he recommended the
formation of a working group for the creation of a model set of uniform
arbitration rules that would reflect and harmonize the world’s predomi-
nant legal traditions. When this proposal was put to state representatives
on the Commission, the response was positive,!** and the UNCITRAL
Secretary-General was accordingly directed to prepare a set of draft rules
in consultation with leading experts in the field.'!”? The draft, which was
presented to the Commission in 1975,'*° took account of the New York
Convention, the ICSID Convention and the 1961 European Convention
on International Commercial Arbitration,!”’ but special attention was
paid to two extant sets of arbitral rules formulated by the UN — the 1966

Arbitration Rules of the UN Economic Commission for Europe’?® (ECE
Rules) and the 1966 Rules for International Commercial Arbitration of
the UN Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East!?? (ECAFE
Rules). Following certain suggestions, a revised set of draft rules with
commentary was prepared the following year,*”° and following consider-
ation, adopted.*’! The General Assembly recommended the Rules to the
UN membership shortly thereafter.

The drafters of the UNCITRAL Rules do not appear to have considered
that their work might apply to a situation in which a state was involved, at
least not overtly. A review piece by Pieter Sanders, perhaps the foremost
expert relied upon by the Secretariat in the preparation of the original
draft, makes no reference to the application of the rules to anything more
than international business transactions.”°* More widely, there does not
appear to have been much faith that the Rules would be successful at all.
They had been deliberately designed to operate independently in a world
then dominated by established arbitral institutions such as the ICC, each
with their own procedural rules.” In 1981, however, Article III(2) of the
Claims Settlement Declaration establishing the Iran—US Claims Tribunal
directed the Tribunal to utilize the Rules, save to the extent modified by the
parties and the Tribunal itself. The Rules of the Tribunal were adopted on
3 May 1983, and reflected the terms of the UNCITRAL Rules, amended so
as to be consistent with the Claims Settlement Declaration.”°* However,
the core procedures of the rules — including those pertaining to interim
relief — remained untouched.

and promoted their use in investor-state dispute resolution. In the BIT
context, arbitration according to the UNCITRAL Rules is now referenced
as a dispute settlement mechanism more often than any other save ICSID
arbitration.””° A similar picture emerges in the multilateral context.?””
With reference to inter-state matters, variants of the UNCITRAL Rules
have been adopted with regularity by Annex VII tribunals under UNC-
LOS, and the Rules further formed the basis for the four sets of Optional
Rules developed by the PCA in the early 1990s,7°° with the 2010 revision
of the Rules influencing the drafting of the consolidated PCA Arbitration
Rules of 2012.7

2 The 2010 Amendments

In 2010, the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules underwent revision, a process
prompted by a 2004 article by Sanders that advocated reform of the Rules
in order to bring them into line with the Model Law.*'° This was followed
by a wider report on the topic by Paulsson and Petrochilos in 2006, which
generally concurred and added that although widely used in investor-state
arbitration, the Rules in their original format were not entirely suited to
that context.?!’ UNCITRAL accordingly directed its Working Group II to
undertake a review of the Rules, although, due to the success of the Rules
to date, the Commission was ‘generally of the view that any revision of
the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules should not alter the structure of the
text, its spirit or its drafting style, and should respect the flexibility of the
text rather than make it more complex’’’? Over several years, Working

On average, the UNCITRAL Rules govern 25 per cent of investment arbitrations in a

per cent of investor-state arbitration claims commenced in 2006: Levine, “Navigating the

122 CONSTITUTIVE INSTRUMENTS AND PROCEDURAL RULES

Group II produced a comprehensive draft, which was adopted by the
Commission in 2010.7°

Within the international commercial arbitration sphere, the adoption
of the 2010 UNCITRAL Rules has been enthusiastic. This cannot as yet
be said to the same extent in the context of investor-state disputes, due
principally to the fact that the jurisdiction of these tribunals is usually
established by treaties or other instruments pre-dating the 2010 amend-
ment that refer simply to ‘the Arbitration Rules of [UNCITRAL]; as
opposed to such Rules ‘as amended from time to time.?!* The same
position applies to inter-state disputes, at least those which are based on
treaties concluded pre-2010. Whilst an argument might perhaps be made
that such treaties should be interpreted dynamically such that what would
previously have been taken as a reference to the 1976 Rules should instead
be deemed a reference to the 2010 amendment,”"° this does not seem like
a plausible reading of such texts, given the ease with which clarificatory
wording might have been added. Nonetheless, it is to be expected that
use of the 2010 Rules in the investor-state context will increase over time
as new investment agreements are concluded per Article 1(2) of the 2010
Rules themselves. Thus, in the case of ASEAN, concluded in 2012, the

[The Group] viewed the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules as one of the most successful
instruments of UNCITRAL and therefore cautioned against any unnecessary amend-
ments or statements being included in the travaux préparatoires that would call into
question the legitimacy of prior applications of the Rules in specific cases. It was
considered that the focus of the revision should be on updating the Rules to meet
changes that had taken place over the last thirty years in arbitral practice, not on
simply making them more complex.

reference to the UNCITRAL Rules in Article 33(1)(d) should be taken as
a reference to the 2010 Rules. Similarly, in the case of bilateral agreements
based on the 2012 US Model BIT, the reference to the UNCITRAL Rules
in Article 24(3)(c) must be taken to refer to the 2010 Rules.

But that is not to say that, notwithstanding the wording of the relevant
agreement, the parties cannot themselves agree to use the 2010 Rules. For
example, in Philip Morris v Australia, the relevant investment agreement,
the 1993 Australia—Hong Kong BIT, declared the UNCITRAL Rules to be
the default procedural law of the arbitration.”!° As discussed, this would
ordinarily require the use of the 1976 Rules. The parties, however, agreed
to the use of the 2010 Rules.?"”

C Provisional Measures Under the UNCITRAL Rules

1 Article 26 of the 1976 Rules
Article 26 of the 1976 Rules provides as follows:

(1) Atthe request of either party, the arbitral tribunal may take any interim
measures it deems necessary in respect of the subject matter of the
dispute, including measures for the conservation of goods forming

third person or the sale of perishable goods.

(2) Such interim measures may be established in the form of an interim
award. The arbitral tribunal shall be entitled to security for the costs
of such measures.

(3) A request for interim measures addressed by a party to a judicial

The travaux préparatories of the 1976 Rules indicates that this provi-
sion was developed from an amalgam of Article VI(6) of the ECAFE
Rules, and the more specific provision of Article 27 of the ECE Rules.”!®
As it is intended to reflect the requirements of international commer-
cial arbitration (e.g. in the reference to sale of goods in paragraph (1)) it
evinces a more commercial flavour than other rules that could conceivable
apply to a broader range of situations. Nonetheless, it remains generally

applicable — the reference to sale of goods and sequestration is an
afterthought to the dominant general reference to the preservation of
the subject matter of the dispute, with the tribunal being given the power
to ‘take any interim measures it deems necessary. Moreover, the bind-
ing nature of the rules is placed beyond doubt by paragraph 2, which
gives the tribunal the option to establish interim relief in the form of an
interim award. Per Article 32(2), such an award is final and binding on
the parties. Finally, paragraph 3 again reflects the notion that the arbitral
process may be backed by a national court, and that recourse to such
a court in the context of interim relief does not undermine the arbitral
bargain as a whole, in a similar manner to other arbitral rules that may
function independently of an arbitral institution, i.e. in situations where
interim relief may be required prior to the constitution of the arbitral
tribunal.

It may be noted that Article 26 of the 1976 Rules possesses less proce-
dural articulation than that furnished, for example, by Article 47 of the
ICSID Convention and Article 39 of the ICSID Rules operating in con-
junction. Any deficiency in this respect, however, is remedied by Article
15(1), giving the tribunal a general power to full procedural lacuna, subject
to the equality of the parties and due process. The travaux préparatoires
provide an additional source of illumination, noting that under Article
26 measures may not be ordered proprio motu, but must be requested by
one of the parties.”

2 Article 26 of the 2010 Rules

In contrast to the somewhat skeletal Article 26 of the 1976 Rules, its
amended equivalent has expanded to become the longest provision in
the 2010 Rules, somewhat undermining the Working Group’s claim that
it would ‘respect the flexibility of the text rather than make it more
complex’. But it is to be remembered that one of the prime movers behind
the amendment was the desire to align the Rules with the New York
Convention and the Model Law. It is this that explains the elaboration
of Article 26.7" Indeed, rather than use Article 26 of the 1976 Rules as a
point of departure, Article 26 of the 2010 Rules is based on Article 17 of
the 2006 Model Law.”?! The provision reads:

PERRY

The arbitral tribunal may, at the request of a party, grant interim

measures.

An interim measure is any temporary measure by which, at any time

prior to the issuance of the award by which the dispute is finally

decided, the arbitral tribunal orders a party, for example and without
limitation, to:

(a) Maintain or restore the status quo pending determination of the
dispute;

(b) ‘Take action that would prevent, or refrain from taking action that
is likely to cause, (i) current or imminent harm or (ii) prejudice
to the arbitral process itself;

(c) Provide a means of preserving assets out of which a subsequent
award may be satisfied; or

(d) Preserve evidence that may be relevant and material to the reso-
lution of the dispute.

The party requesting an interim measure under paragraphs 2(a) to

(c) shall satisfy the arbitral tribunal that:

(a) Harm not adequately reparable by an award of damages is likely to
result if the measure is not ordered, and such harm substantially
outweighs the harm that is likely to result to the party against
whom the measure is directed if the measure is granted; and

(b) There is a reasonable possibility that the requesting party will
succeed on the merits of the claim. The determination on this
possibility shall not affect the discretion of the arbitral tribunal
in making any subsequent determination.

With regard to a request for an interim measure under paragraph 2

(d), the requirements in paragraphs 3(a) and (b) shall apply only to

the extent the arbitral tribunal considers appropriate.

The arbitral tribunal may modify, suspend or terminate an interim

measure it has granted, upon application ofany party or, in exceptional

circumstances and upon prior notice to the parties, on the arbitral
tribunal’s own initiative.

The arbitral tribunal may require the party requesting an interim

measure to provide appropriate security in connection with the

measure.

The arbitral tribunal may require any party promptly to disclose any

material change in the circumstances on the basis of which the interim

measure was requested or granted.

The party requesting an interim measure may be liable for any costs

and damages caused by the measure to any party if the arbitral tri-

bunal later determines that, in the circumstances then prevailing, the
measure should not have been granted. The arbitral tribunal may
award such costs and damages at any point during the proceedings.

A request for interim measures addressed by any party to a judicial

authority shall not be deemed incompatible with the agreement to

arbitrate, or as a waiver of that agreement.

126 CONSTITUTIVE INSTRUMENTS AND PROCEDURAL RULES

As may be appreciated, Article 26 of the 2010 Rules provides the pro-
cedural complexity that was lacking in its 1976 equivalent.’ It reflects
closely Article 17 of the 2006 Model Law, which was itself expanded so
that municipal courts might feel more comfortable in awarding interim
relief.?*° Article 17, however, was not copied exactly, with certain amend-
ments made in order to account for the difference in function and scope
between the Rules and the Model Law. Beyond this, however, the provision
broadly reflects the procedural standard for provisional measures seen in
the other instruments in this chapter. Paragraph 1 establishes the power to
award interim relief, but states that this may only occur on the request of
a party, thereby rendering express what had previously only been implied
in the travaux. Paragraph 2 preserves the general power of the tribunal
to order whatever provisional measures it sees fit, and provides a list of
illustrative examples that are ‘without limitation’. Notably, the reference
to the ‘subject matter of the dispute’ that was present in the 1976 Rules
was omitted, giving the provision a less restrictive focus, and permitting
the granting of wider measures, i.e. those designed for the prevention of
the further escalation of the dispute.

Paragraph 3 of Article 26 introduces substantive considerations to
the application of the provision by requiring the party seeking relief to
demonstrate irreparable harm, that the grant of relief would not unduly
burden the other party, and a reasonable prospect of success on the mer-
its. Interestingly, no specific mention is made of the need to demonstrate
prima facie jurisdiction — although such an element could easily be sub-
sumed within the wider need to demonstrate a prima facie case on the
merits. Paragraph 5 provides the tribunal with the power to modify or
terminate its earlier decisions, either on the application of one of the
parties or proprio motu, but places a restriction on the latter in requiring
modification with notice and only in exceptional cases. Significantly, the
provision also indicates that a frivolous request for provisional measures
may have adverse consequences — paragraph 6 provides for the pledging
of security against an award of interim relief, and paragraph 8 that a party
may be liable for costs and damages arising out of provisional measures at

a later date. Paragraph 9 preserves the role of domestic courts in awarding
interim relief under the UNCITRAL regime.

One further notable omission from the 2010 Rules is any express ref-
erence to provisional measures as interim awards. Accordingly, it is open
to doubt as to whether provisional measures are binding, at least on the
wording of the text. As Caplan and Caron note, however, it is highly likely
that such measures remain binding”** — Article 34 gives tribunals the
ability to make ‘separate awards on different issues at different times’, a
form of wording that seems likely to include interim relief. Moreover, the
notion that provisional measures are not binding under the 2010 Rules is
not supported by discussions within the Working Group.””°

VI Other International Courts and Tribunals

Clearly, the above rules do not exhaust the range of international courts
and tribunals capable of awarding provisional measures. Nonetheless, for
the reasons detailed in the introduction,?”° they are the focus of this book,
to the exclusion of other traditions. For the sake of completeness, however,
those courts and tribunals that have been excluded will be discussed
briefly.

A The European Court of Justice

One of the more prominent excluded regimes is that of the European
Court of Justice (ECJ), which forms part of the Court of Justice of the
European Union. Established in 1952 and based in Luxembourg, the EC]
is the highest authority on questions of EU law. The Court is governed,
inter alia, by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union?’
(TFEU). This contains one of the broadest powers to award binding
interim relief within the system of international courts and tribunals,
with TFEU Article 278 giving the Court the power to suspend a con-
tested measure, and TFEU Article 279 providing simply that ‘[t]he Court

of Justice of the European Union may in any cases before it prescribe
any necessary interim measures.””8 Further rigour is provided by Articles
160-166 of the EC)’s procedural rules.””? Naturally, the Court has inter-
preted these provisions extremely broadly, and has produced abundant
case law to match. As with the ICJ, substantive limitations to the ECJ’s
power to award interim relief have been introduced: applications must
demonstrate urgency,”*° a probability of irreparable prejudice’*' and a
prima facie case on the merits.**”

B_ International Human Rights Regimes

Another group of courts and tribunals that utilizes provisional measures
in the settlement of disputes are those composed according to the vari-
ous human rights regimes,”°* including the European Court of Human
Rights,”** the Inter-American Court of Human Rights,”°° the UN Human

Rights Committee,”*° the UN Committee Against Torture”*’ and the
Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.?*8 In terms of the subject
matter of interim measures, these institutions share a common purpose,
viz. the prevention or termination of human rights abuses pending res-
olution of a complaint. Applications are frequently made with respect to
state-sponsored executions, extradition or deportment, the protection of
threatened classes of person (e.g. witnesses, plaintiffs, lawyers, judges,
journalists and opposition politicians) and so forth.?°? Whilst provi-
sional measures ordered by the European and Inter-American Courts
may be considered binding on the parties, there persists some debates
as to whether such relief ordered by the quasi-judicial committees pos-
sesses similar characteristics,”*° although state compliance is the usual
consequence of such orders.**! In terms of substantive preconditions, the
human rights bodies have generally adopted the international standards
of other courts and tribunals.”

C_ International Commercial Arbitration

The final category of excluded tribunals concerns those bodies arbi-
trating international commercial disputes between two private parties.
As discussed, some of these function on an ad hoc basis and award
interim relief on the basis of Article 26 of the 1976 or 2010 UNCITRAL
Rules. However, almost all institutional arbitration rules also grant tri-
bunals the power to grant interim relief where required.”** Moreover, the
