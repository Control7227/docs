Introduction

This chapter examines the power of international courts to grant provisional meas-
ures and analyses whether there is an emerging common practice among inter-
national courts in this regard. At the outset, it should be noted that there is some

variation in the terminology used in the constitutive instruments, rules and prac-
tice of international tribunals to describe provisional measures. They are variously
referred to as ‘provisional measures’, ‘interim measures’ ,? ‘interim measures of
protection’ ,3 and ‘precautionary measures’ .4 For the sake of convenience, the meas-
ures will here be referred to as ‘provisional measures’, for there is no distinction
between the various terms. The terminological differences also extend to the terms
used to describe the manner in which these measures are granted. The ICJ and the
ECHR ‘indicate’ provisional measures,> the [TLOS and UNCLOS tribunals ‘pre-
scribe’ them,® the IACHR can both ‘adopt’? and ‘order’’ provisional measures,
ICSID tribunals ‘recommend’ provisional measures,? and the [ACommHR
‘request[s] that the state concerned adopt precautionary measures’.1° Practical dif-
ferences can arise depending on the verb used to describe how such measures are
granted. For instance, a provisional measure which is ‘prescribed’ has legal force,
whereas a provisional measure which is ‘recommended’ arguably does not. In this
chapter, the power will usually be referred to as the power to ‘grant’ provisional
measures, which is intended as a neutral term; the question of whether provisional
measures are binding is addressed later in this chapter.

This chapter begins with a discussion of the purposes of the power to grant
provisional measures, and then turns to the question of whether all international
courts have that power. International courts with an express statutory power to
grant provisional measures are examined, and the question is then asked whether
international courts lacking an express power can nonetheless exercise the power
as an inherent power. Finally, any common features of the exercise of the power
are addressed.

Power to Grant Provisional Measures 121

I. Purpose of Provisional Measures in
International Adjudication

The essential purpose of the power of international courts to grant provisional
measures is the preservation of the respective rights of the parties pending the
decision on the merits, and the safeguarding of the jurisdiction of the inter-
national court to render a judgment which is effective.!! In this regard, the ICJ has
stated that its power ‘has as its object to preserve the respective rights of the par-
ties, and presupposes that irreparable prejudice should not be caused to rights
which are the subject of dispute in judicial proceedings’.!? This protective func-
tion is illustrated in the French term for provisional measures, ‘mesures conserva-
toires 13 The need for international courts to be able to grant interim relief stems
from the fact that once an application is made instituting proceedings, that court
might not be in a position to determine the rights in dispute for some time. In the
intervening period, those rights might be prejudiced by events which would pre-
vent the international court from being able to render an effective decision, thus
rendering its jurisdiction nugatory.!4 This purpose thus reflects the function of
international courts to settle disputes by adjudication.

Another purpose of provisional measures could be the maintenance of the
status quo.!> This purpose was referred to in the provision conferring the power
on the Central American Court of Justice,!® and during the discussion on the
PCY Rules of Court in 1931, Judge Negulesco observed that provisional measures
‘sometimes ... were regarded as designed to preserve rights claimed in an action at
law, sometimes their object was to re-establish or safeguard the status quo ante’ 7
Germany argued in LaGrand that ‘the United States should restore the status quo
ante in the case of Walter LaGrand’;!8 and Mexico made a similar argument in

Avena.'° International courts do not, however, make frequent reference to this
purpose in their orders.

Yet another purpose which is often referred to by international courts is the
avoidance of any aggravation or extension ofa dispute.?° This purpose was referred
to in the constitutive instrument of the Central American Court of Justice,?! and
the PCIJ and ICJ have made orders with this aim in many cases in which provi-
sional measures have been granted since the power was first exercised by the PCI in
Electricity Company of Sofia and Bulgaria.?? In granting provisional measures other
international courts, including ICSID tribunals and the ITLOS, have also urged
parties to avoid aggravating and extending the dispute.?3

Other purposes of provisional measures, which are related to the preservation
of the parties’ rights and the safeguarding of the jurisdiction of international
courts, may include the preservation of evidence, without which a party might
not be able to prove its claim and the tribunal might not be able to settle the dis-
pute;?4 the granting of discovery orders;?> making orders to ensure the satisfactory
conduct of procedure before the court;?6 and the making of orders staying domes-

tic court proceedings.?” Finally, under article 290 of UNCLOS, the ITLOS and

other rules (in particular Article 43 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 34 of the ICSID Arbitration
Rules). Indeed, the two procedures are aimed at different issues: Article 47 is designed to ensure that
the Arbitral Tribunal can properly discharge its mandate, whilst Article 43 is one element in a range of
provisions that structures how the mandate is to be discharged.’

other UNCLOS tribunals have the power to grant provisional measures not only
to preserve the respective rights of the parties, but also to prevent serious harm to
the marine environment.?8 This purpose reflects the importance of the environ-
mental protection function of international tribunals having jurisdiction under

the dispute settlement regime of UNCLOS.?9

II. Source of the Power to Grant Provisional Measures

A. Constitutive Instruments of International Courts

Many international courts have an express power in their constitutive instruments
to grant provisional measures.>° Following earlier precedents,3! an express power
was conferred on the PCIJ in article 41 (1) of the PCIJ Statute, which was retained
in the ICJ Statute in 1945:

The Court shall have the power to indicate, if it considers that circumstances so require,
any provisional measures which ought to be taken to preserve the respective rights of either

party.?

Some multilateral agreements for the settlement of disputes also confer such a
power on tribunals charged with settling disputes;35 and the constitutive instru-
ments of a large number of other international courts expressly confer the power.

These include the ECJ,34 ICSID tribunals,3> the IACHR,¢ the ITLOS and
UNCLOS tribunals,37 NAFTA tribunals,38 and the African Court on Human

This list of international courts possessing an express statutory power to grant
provisional measures does not include all international courts. Notable among
those lacking an express power in their constitutive instruments are tribunals estab-
lished under the auspices of the PCA, WTO panels and the WTO Appellate Body.
It has been suggested that PCA tribunals might have a power to grant provisional
measures under the Hague Conventions,#° and WTO panels and the Appellate

Body might also have the power under the terms of their Working Procedures,4!
although this is doubtful.

In the absence of an express statutory power to grant provisional measures,
many international courts and tribunals have found that they have a source of
competence to make such orders. This is by inclusion of the power in their rules of
procedure, by reliance on a general principle of law, and by asserting the existence
of an inherent power to grant interim relief.

B. Rules of Procedure of International Courts

Some international courts and tribunals have arrogated to themselves the power
to grant provisional measures in their rules of procedure. Even though the power
to frame rules is generally conferred by the constitutive instrument, the practice
of international courts in including the power demonstrates that certain inter-
national courts consider such a power to be necessary in order to carry out their
functions,*? for the rules of procedure of these international courts are drafted by
the courts themselves without the need for ratification by the states parties. These
international courts need to be distinguished from those whose rules of procedure
are drafted by the states parties or the administrative body of the court; thus, the
power of PCA tribunals to grant provisional measures under the Optional Rules
of 1992 cannot be considered as providing judicial support for the inherent nature
of the power,*> nor can the power of arbitral tribunals constituted under the ICC
Rules of Arbitration or the UNCITRAL Rules.44 In addition, the Rules of the
Iran—US Claims Tribunal were essentially agreed by the parties, rather than by the
Tribunal itself.4>

Many international judicial bodies have included the power to grant provi-
sional measures in their rules of procedure. 33 of the 36 MATs which were estab-
lished after the First World War included the power to grant interim relief in their
Rules of Procedure.46 The ECommHR, prior to its dissolution in 1998, exercised
a power to grant interim relief which it arrogated to itself in Rule 36 of its Rules of
Procedure in 1974.47 The ECHR has also granted itself such a power in Rule 39 of
its Rules of Court,’ as have other international judicial and quasi-judicial bodies,
including the Human Rights Committee of the UN,*? the Court of Justice of the

C. Power to Grant Provisional Measures
as a General Principle of Law

Many international courts have held that there is a general principle of law that
parties to litigation must abstain from any act which might exercise a prejudicial
effect on any future judgment, or aggravate or extend the dispute. This was recog-

nised in Electricity Company of Sofia and Bulgaria, where the PCIJ referred to:

the principle universally accepted by international tribunals... to the effect that the parties
to a case must abstain from any measure capable of exercising a prejudicial effect in regard
to the execution of the decision to be given.*®

Several writers have suggested that there is also a general principle of law common
to many domestic legal systems that litigants are entitled to some form of relief
pendente lite.57 Such procedural devices in domestic legal systems include the
interlocutory injunction in English law, the temporary restraining order and the
preliminary injunction in the United States, the ordonnance de réferé in French
law, the einstweilige Verfiigung in German law, and the provvedimenti d’urgenza in
Italian law.°8 On the basis of the widespread existence of the principle of interim
relief in domestic legal systems, it is suggested that the power to grant provisional

measures can be characterized as a ‘general principle of law within the meaning of
article 38(1)(c) of the ICJ Statute, and that international tribunals may rely on
this general principle as a source of the power to grant provisional measures.

Notwithstanding the widespread availability of interim relief in municipal legal
systems, the objection has been made that the existence of a general principle
obliging parties to litigation to refrain from prejudicing the rights in dispute does
not empower the tribunal to grant provisional measures.>*? This objection appears
to be based on the premise that international courts cannot derive jurisdictional
powers from general principles of law, but rather must base their powers on the
consent of the parties as expressed in the constitutive instrument.©

This objection can be rejected. As has been seen in chapter 2, international law
does not make a clear distinction between substance and procedure, and there is
no reason why general principles of law should not be a source of procedural law.
While there are limitations to an argument about the existence of inherent powers
being based on general principles of law, the practice of domestic courts in making
interim relief available is so widespread that general principles of law provide a
solid basis for the existence of the power.

D. Power to Grant Provisional Measures as an Inherent Power

Finally, many international courts have asserted the power to grant provisional
measures as an inherent power. The proposition that international courts have an
inherent power to grant provisional measures has attracted the support of many
writers.®! For instance, Edvard Hambro, referring to the ICJ, has stated that ‘the
Court in exercising its authority under Article 41 does only in effect give life and
blood to a rule that already exists in principle’.©? Other writers, however, have argued
that the power to grant provisional measures cannot be considered inherent.®> For

instance, Shabtai Rosenne has stated that ‘every international court or tribunal
requires a specific provision in its constituent instrument to empower it to order
provisional measures’;°4 and Dumbauld argued that ‘[t]he mere fact that a tri-
bunal has jurisdiction over the dispute in chief does not, without more, give it
jurisdiction to order interim measures’.®> Proponents of this view argue that since
the power is specifically provided for in the constitutive instrument of some
international courts and left out of others, this suggests that the power must be
expressly conferred.®° Further, it has been argued that there is no practice of inter-
national tribunals asserting this power where it has not been expressly conferred.*”

The following paragraphs, however, suggest that the power to grant provisional
measures can be exercised as an inherent power by international tribunals on the
basis that such a power is necessary for the performance of their functions. This
suggestion that international courts have an inherent power to grant provisional
measures is also buttressed by substantial international judicial practice.

1. The Power is necessary to carry out the Functions of
International Courts

It has been observed that the primary functions of international courts are
twofold: the settlement of disputes by adjudication, and the proper administra-
tion of international justice; and it is suggested that the power of international
courts to grant provisional measures is necessary for the carrying out of both these
functions. First, the function of international courts in settling disputes by adjudi-
cation entails the rendering of an effective judgment, that is, a judgment which
has not been stultified by the acts of parties prejudicing the rights in dispute. If
international courts were unable to make orders preventing any prejudicial action
and safeguard their jurisdiction to render an effective decision, their function in
settling the dispute would be undermined. At the same time, the function of
international courts in administering justice would not be served if the very ability
of international courts to do justice were frustrated.°® Sir Gerald Fitzmaurice has
argued that the power to grant provisional measures should be considered an
inherent power due to the necessity of the power ‘in order to ensure that justice is
done and that the eventual decision of the Court on the merits is not stultified by
intermediate action on the part of one or other party rendering such decision
unenforceable or unavailing’.® Significantly, he has argued that all international
courts have the power to order provisional measures:

Power to Grant Provisional Measures 129

In short, if there is ever a case at all for conferring this faculty expressly on an international
tribunal (be it the Court or another), there is automatically a case for regarding all inter-
national tribunals as inherently invested with it.7°

The proposition that the power to grant provisional measures is necessary to carry
out the function of international courts reflects the principle that the jurisdiction
of international courts should be effective.” As parties to disputes have generally
consented to the jurisdiction of international courts to make a determination on
the merits of those disputes, it is suggested that the parties must have intended the
international court to have the power to ensure the effectiveness of any future
judgment and avoid the adjudicative process being rendered a futile exercise.”

In addition to the functions of international courts in settling the dispute by
adjudication and in ensuring the proper administration of international justice, it
is suggested that a further function of international adjudication is relevant in
connection with their power to grant provisional measures. This is the function of
international courts to manage disputes.7> This function can be seen in the fre-
quency with which international tribunals grant provisional measures which
require the states parties to the dispute to refrain from acts which will ‘aggravate or
extend the dispute’, even though the constitutive instruments of international
courts do not foresee the granting of provisional measures for this purpose.” It is
suggested that this practice evinces the existence of a broader underlying inherent
power to grant provisional measures.”> This suggestion was put to the ICJ by
Greece in Aegean Sea Continental Shelf, but the ICJ did not decide the point,”¢
although later, in Frontier Dispute, the Chamber of the ICJ claimed that such pro-
visional measures could be made under article 41: it held that it possessed
‘by virtue of Article 41 of the Statute the power to indicate provisional measures
with a view to preventing the aggravation or extension of the dispute whenever it
considers that circumstances so require’.77 On its face, it is difficult to see how

130 A Common Law of International Adjudication

article 41 confers such a power, but the Chamber's explanation can be understood
as suggesting that it had the power to grant provisional measures for the manage-
ment of the dispute, in addition to the narrower purpose of the preservation of
rights.78 This purpose can also be discerned in the [TLOS Order for provisional
measures in OX Plant, which granted a provisional measure requiring the parties
to enter into consultations to exchange information, monitor the effects of the
MOxX Plant on the Irish Sea, and devise measures to prevent pollution.79 It is made
explicit in the ICSID Tribunal’s Procedural Order No 3 in Biwater Gauff (Tanzania)
Ltd v Tanzania, where the Tribunal observed that:

It is now settled in both treaty and international commercial arbitration that an arbitral
tribunal is entitled to direct the parties not to take any step that might (1) harm or preju-
dice the integrity of the proceedings, or (2) aggravate or exacerbate the dispute. Both may
be seen as a particular type of provisional measure... or simply as a facet of the tribunal’s
overall procedural powers and its responsibility for its own process.8°

It is suggested that such provisional measures are based on the function of man-
aging the resolution of international disputes, and that this function may, in certain
cases, form the basis of the power of international courts to grant such measures.

2. Practice of International Courts supporting the Existence of the Power

There is also substantial arbitral and judicial practice supporting the existence of an
inherent power. This can be found in instances where international courts have
granted such measures even though their constitutive instrument and rules of proced-
ure do not provide for such a power. These cases include the decision of the arbitral
tribunal which met under the Treaty of Corinto in 1907 to determine the dispute
between Honduras and Nicaragua.®! Under its constitutive instrument, this tri-
bunal had no formal power to grant provisional measures; article 11 merely obliged
parties not to extend or aggravate any dispute. Nevertheless, the tribunal declared
that for it to be able to examine the dispute, it was necessary for Nicaraguan and
Honduran troops to retreat from the frontier and put themselves on a footing of
peace.®? It is suggested that this order was akin to a provisional measure.®3

A further example is provided by an order of the Anglo-German MAT in
Gramophone Co Ltd v Deutsche Grammophon AG.84 This MAT also lacked an
express power to grant interim relief. Nonetheless, the tribunal members stated
that they were ‘of opinion that they have jurisdiction in this case’, and it was

Power to Grant Provisional Measures 131

‘enough to say that the Tribunal are opinion [sic] that there are sufficient reasons
for granting a provisional protection for the interests of the Claimants, which
otherwise would be seriously endangered’.85

Another early example is provided by the Trail Smelter case.8¢ In this arbitra-
tion, the United States sought compensation from Canada for damage caused by
transboundary pollution from a smelter in British Columbia. Before it was able to
render a final award, the tribunal established a ‘temporary regime’ with which the
parties were obliged to comply, even though the parties had not expressly asked it
to do so.87 This regime was, effectively, a form of provisional measure, as it sought
to preserve the rights in dispute.88

In addition, the ECommHR also granted provisional measures several times
prior to including a specific power in its Rules of Procedure in 1974, even though
its previous rules of 1955 did not contain the power.8® As a final example, the
ECJ held in Camera Care v Commission that a non-judicial body, the European
Commission, had the power to grant interim relief, even though the EC Treaty
and the relevant EC Regulation did not expressly confer such a power on the
Commission.?° The ECJ held that despite the absence of an express power, the
Commission must be able ‘to take protective measures to the extent to which they
might appear indispensable in order to avoid the exercise of [its] power to make
decisions ... from becoming ineffectual or even illusory’.?!

Finally, further support can be found in the jurisprudence of international
courts which have expressly relied on an inherent power to provide interim relief,
even though they also had a textual basis for the granting of provisional measures.
For instance, the Iran—US Claims Tribunal has held that in addition to the power
conferred in article 26 of its Rules, it has ‘an inherent power... to conserve the
respective rights of the parties and to ensure that this Tribunal’s jurisdiction and
authority are made fully effective’.9? It has also considered that the scope of its
power to grant interim protection is not limited by article 26 of the Rules, accord-
ing to which interim measures must pertain to the subject matter of the dispute.
The Tribunal has held that it may issue interim measures which protect its “jurisdic-
tion and authority’.9> Further, it has held that it can grant ‘temporary restraining

measures’ pending consideration of the request for provisional measures, in order
to preserve its ability ‘to act effectively on a request for interim measures’.°4

Additional support is found in the decision of the Third Chamber of the
Arbitral Tribunal on Property, Rights and Interests in Germany in Veerman v
Germany.°> Here, although the tribunal had an express power to order interim
measures with respect to rights which are the subject of proceedings, the tribunal
referred to its ‘inherent power to issue such orders as may be necessary to conserve
the respective rights of the parties...and thereby to ensure that this Tribunal’s
jurisdiction and authority are made fully effective’.%°

Another example can be found in the practice of the IACHR. It has, on at least
one occasion, referred to the existence of an inherent power as well as express
powers in granting provisional measures. In granting provisional measures in
Velasquez Rodriguez, it relied on:

Articles 63(2), 33 and 62(3) of the American Convention on Human Rights, Articles 1
and 2 of the Statute of the Court and Article 23 of the Rules of Procedure and its character
as a judicial body and the powers which derive therefrom.?”

Before the PCIJ and the ICJ, suggestions have been made in the course of oral
argument that the International Court has an inherent power to grant provisional
measures, in addition to the express power conferred in article 41 of the ICJ
Statute.?8 The International Court has not made a judicial pronouncement on
this question, and maintains the practice of relying expressly on article 41 in
orders for provisional measures, yet individual judges have certainly expressed
their views. In his separate opinion in Northern Cameroons, Sit Gerald Fitzmaurice
stated that the power to grant provisional measures, together with the ICJ’s inci-
dental jurisdiction, is ‘an inherent jurisdiction, the power to exercise which is a
necessary condition of the Court—or any court of law—being able to function at
all’.°° There have also been other strong pronouncements by individual judges
that the ICJ has an inherent power to grant provisional measures. !°°

The ICJ’s approach to relying on article 41 of the ICJ Statute in granting provi-
sional measures is mirrored in the practice of the I[TLOS and ICSID tribunals. In

on article 290(1) or article 290(5) for the prescription of provisional measures.!°!
ICSID tribunals also appear to have consistently relied on the power conferred by
article 47 of the ICSID Convention in granting provisional measures. !©2

E. Limitations on the Power to Grant Provisional Measures

The power to grant provisional measures might not be necessary for carrying out
the functions of every international court.!°3 For instance, tribunals operating
under the PCA and WTO panels have, so far, operated successfully without an
express power, as did Conciliation Commissions under the Peace Treaty with Italy
(1947), and the Mexican Claims Commissions (1923-34).!% It is possible that
provisional measures are less relevant in proceedings before PCA tribunals; this is
because PCA tribunals are not permanent bodies which can be convened at short
notice for the purposes of a provisional measures request. Even so, PCA tribunals
routinely include a power to grant provisional measures in their rules of proced-
ure, and those PCA tribunals selecting the PCA Optional Rules of Procedure also
have the power.!° In addition, ad hoc tribunals have in some disputes rendered
an ‘interim award’, which is akin to provisional measures as it has had the effect of
preserving rights or maintaining the status quo.!°

The position of WTO panels and the Appellate Body is more complex. While
the exercise of the power would be consistent with the functions of WTO panels
and the Appellate Body in setting disputes, the existence of a power to grant provi-
sional measures may be inconsistent with the terms of the DSU. At the outset it
might be noted that an appellate court, such as the Appellate Body, is unlikely to
be called upon to grant provisional measures. By the time a dispute reaches the
appellate stage, the need for provisional measures will be less pressing than at the
commencement ofa dispute. Accordingly, this section will focus on the possibility
of WTO panels granting provisional measures.

134 A Common Law of International Adjudication

First, it might be argued that a power to grant provisional measures would be
inconsistent with the short timeframes provided for in the DSU. The usual time
between the lodging of a request for consultations to the adoption of a panel
report by the DSB is between six and nine months.!°7 This contrasts with the
position before other international tribunals, where it could take years from the
date of the institution of proceedings until final judgment.!°8 But the shorter time
frames involved in WTO dispute settlement need not exclude the relevance of
provisional measures. Even over a short period, significant damage might be done
to a state’s economy.!°

Second, it might be argued that the DSU already provides for expedited proced-
ures in cases of ‘urgency’, such as where perishable goods or prohibited subsidies
are concerned.!!© But this factor also need not rule out the relevance of provi-
sional measures. Even where shorter time frames are involved, the rights of the
parties can still be harmed, even though the state whose economy is suffering can
levy countervailing duties on imported goods which are thought to be benefiting
from prohibited subsidies. !!!

A third factor militating against a power of WTO panels to grant provisional
measures is that remedies under the WTO dispute settlement system are typically
forward-looking rather than retrospective.!!? That is, the right to a remedy arises
on the date of adoption of the report, not the date of the alleged internationally
wrongful act, or the date of the commencement of the action. This contrasts with
the position under general international law, where states responsible for an inter-
nationally wrongful act are under an obligation to make ‘full reparation’ to the
injured state,113 and ‘wipe out all the consequences’ of the breach of international

law.114 The non-availability of retrospective remedies in WTO dispute settlement
might permit the inference to be drawn that WTO panels do not have an inherent
power to preserve the rights of the parties during the pendency of the proceedings,
for there is no right to compensation for any damage to the complainant state
which occurs prior to the adoption of the report.

It is suggested, however, that WTO remedies are not exclusively forward-
looking. In a prohibited subsidies dispute, Australia—Leather, a WYO panel had
held that subsidies paid by the Australian government to a local producer of
automotive leather were inconsistent with Australia’s obligations under the SCM
Agreement, and ordered that they be withdrawn ‘without delay’.!!5 The panel
constituted under article 21(5) of the DSU to monitor the implementation of the
original panel report ordered that the subsidies be reimbursed.1!¢ In so doing, the
panel found that an order under article 4(7) of the SCM Agreement was not lim-
ited to prospective action, but could encompass repayment of the prohibited sub-
sidy.!!7 This panel report therefore suggests that remedies in prohibited subsidies
disputes can seek to ‘wipe out all the consequences’ of the wrongful act.!18 This
provides support for the proposition that the parties’ rights can be protected dur-
ing the pendency of such proceedings. Nevertheless, this is an isolated case, and in
the absence of further practice by WTO panels, it is difficult to characterize the
function of WTO dispute settlement as reflecting the function of other inter-
national adjudicatory bodies in preserving the parties’ rights pending final judg-
ment. It might be that a power to grant provisional measures, if it exists in WTO
dispute settlement, is limited to prohibited subsidies cases and anti-dumping
disputes, where it is possible that a retroactive remedy might be available.!19

III. Common Features in the Exercise of the Power

The power to grant provisional measures—whether it be as a result of an express
power, a general principle of law, or an inherent power—is one that has been exer-
cised with relative frequency by international courts, resulting in much jurispru-

question whether international courts exercise this power consistently. First,
whether international courts need to have established jurisdiction over the merits
of the dispute in order to have jurisdiction to grant provisional measures; second,
what circumstances are relevant to the granting of provisional measures; third,

courts can grant provisional measures ultra petita or proprio motu.

A. Question of Jurisdiction over the Merits

The relationship between the power of international courts to grant provisional
measures and their jurisdiction over the merits of a dispute has been a controver-
sial question.!2! The constitutive instruments of many international tribunals do
not clarify whether jurisdiction over the merits must be clearly established before
that tribunal has jurisdiction to grant provisional measures. Over time, various
positions have been put forward, ranging from the view that the question of juris-
diction over the merits has to be conclusively established,12? to the view that the
question of the court’s jurisdiction is irrelevant to the granting of provisional meas-
ures.!23 These two extreme positions are widely regarded as unsatisfactory. On
one hand, if a party has to wait until the international court’s jurisdiction over the
merits has been affirmatively established, the length of time involved in cases of
complexity would often deprive any provisional measures of their efficacy in pre-
serving the rights of the parties.!24 On the other hand, if international courts dis-
regarded the question of jurisdiction before making an order restraining a party's
right to act, arguably this would contravene the principle of consent, on which the
jurisdiction of international courts is based.!25 Other tests regarding the relevance
of jurisdiction have also been proposed.!26 The position which the ICJ has
adopted is that it need not finally satisfy itself that it has jurisdiction on the merits
of the case, but ought not to indicate provisional measures unless the state request-
ing provisional measures can show a prima facie basis on which the jurisdiction of

the ICJ might be founded. This test was first proposed by Sir Hersch Lauterpacht

Power to Grant Provisional Measures 137

in his separate opinion in /nterhandel, where, significantly, he based this view on
uniform ‘international arbitral and judicial practice’:

The correct principle which emerges from these apparently conflicting considerations and
which has been uniformly adopted in international arbitral and judicial practice is as fol-
lows: The Court may properly act under the terms of Article 41 provided that there is in
existence an instrument such as a Declaration of Acceptance of the Optional Clause, eman-
ating from the Parties to the dispute, which prima facie confers jurisdiction upon the Court
and which incorporates no reservations obviously excluding its jurisdiction. !?7

The ICJ adopted this test in Fisheries Jurisdiction'?® and Nuclear Tests,!2° and has
since been regularly repeated in requests for provisional measures.!3°

Other international courts appear to have adopted this requirement of prima
facie jurisdiction over the merits of the dispute. In the case of the ITLOS and
other tribunals having jurisdiction under UNCLOS, the question is expressly
addressed in article 290(1) and 290(5). Together, the effect of these provisions
requires that the court or tribunal determining a request for provisional measures
must be satisfied that the tribunal to which the merits of the dispute are ultimately
submitted has a prima facie basis of jurisdiction over the dispute. This question
is complicated by the choice made by states parties when signing or ratifying
UNCLOS. Under article 287, parties may choose to refer disputes to the ICJ, the
ITLOS or arbitral tribunals constituted in accordance with Annex VII or Annex
VII. Article 290(1) applies to requests for provisional measures to the body which
will have jurisdiction over the merits of the dispute, and article 290(5) applies to
requests for provisional measures made to bodies other than the tribunal which
will determine the merits of the dispute.

Similarly, the jurisdiction of ICSID tribunals does not need to be conclusively
established before they can grant provisional measures.!3! Under article 36(3) of
the ICSID Convention, upon receipt of an application, the Secretary-General of
ICSID registers the request for arbitration and constitutes a tribunal unless it is
found that the dispute is manifestly outside the jurisdiction of ICSID.132 This
preliminary examination of jurisdiction before the claim even reaches the tribunal
forms a type of prima facie test for whether the tribunal has jurisdiction. It is then
up to the tribunal to decide whether it wants to accept the Secretary-General’s
registration as a sufficient basis or whether it wants to form its own prima facie

view on jurisdiction before recommending provisional measures.133 ICSID
tribunals have followed this practice, and at least one tribunal has made express
reference to the standard of a prima facie basis of jurisdiction. !54

Other international courts also require a jurisdictional link before granting pro-
visional measures. The Iran—US Claims Tribunal has stated that it must be satis-
fied that it has prima facie jurisdiction over the dispute before granting provisional
measures.!3> The IACHR also considers questions of jurisdiction in granting pro-
visional measures, although the issue of jurisdiction is usually less complex before
this body. Article 63(2) of the American Convention on Human Rights, which
contains the express power, makes no mention of a specific jurisdictional require-
ment, but it would seem apparent that the IACHR can only grant such measures
if the states parties to the litigation have accepted its jurisdiction.!5° Judge
Buergenthal has suggested that it is sufficient for the ACHR to find that it has
prima facie jurisdiction over the merits.197 In practice, states appear to have chal-
lenged the jurisdiction of the IACHR to grant provisional measures on one occa-
sion; this was in James v Trinidad and Tobago, where the respondent state had
withdrawn its consent to the IACHR’s jurisdiction, and argued that the IACHR
lacked jurisdiction ratione temporis.138 The IACHR nonetheless granted provi-
sional measures, as Trinidad and Tobago had not denounced the American
Convention until after its alleged violations of it.!39 Usually, however, the ACHR
simply makes a finding that the respondent state is a state party to the convention,
and proceeds to grant the measures, if the other criteria are satisfied.!4° Questions
of jurisdiction to grant provisional measures have not arisen before the ECHR;
this is perhaps due to the fact that there is no provision in the European HR
Convention empowering the ECHR to grant provisional measures, and orders
made under Rule 39 of its Rules have, until the Mamatkulov judgment in 2003,
been considered non-binding.!4! The question of jurisdiction may arise in future
requests for provisional measures.

B. Circumstances Relevant to the Granting of Provisional Measures

The constitutive instruments of international courts often provide that the court
may grant provisional measures if ‘the circumstances so require’,!4? or if to do so
would be ‘appropriate under the circumstances’.!43 The constitutive instruments
are generally silent, however, on what these words actually mean, and inter-
national courts have accordingly developed criteria in their case law. There are many
circumstances which might be considered pertinent to requests for provisional
measures, but there are two criteria which have emerged as being crucial. One
reflects the purpose of provisional measures, being the preservation of the parties’
rights from irreparable prejudice pending the decision on the merits, and the
other criterion is urgency.

1. Prevention of Irreparable Prejudice to the Rights of the Parties

The preservation of the parties’ rights from irreparable prejudice is one of the two
criteria widely adopted by international courts in deciding on requests for provi-
sional measures. For example, the ICJ clarified in Fisheries Jurisdiction that the
power to grant provisional measures ‘presupposes that irreparable prejudice
should not be caused to rights which are the subject of a dispute in judicial pro-
ceedings’,!44 and this has been repeated almost verbatim in subsequent cases.!4°
There are two comments that need to be made regarding this statement. First, the
ICJ only has jurisdiction to order provisional measures which are ‘needed to pro-
tect rights which might form the subject matter of a judgment under the treaty or
treaties which the Court determines afford a prima facie basis for its jurisdic-
tion’.!46 Second, the rights of the parties should only properly be the subject of an
order for provisional measures if the probability exists that they will be damaged
in a way that cannot be made good in a later judgment on the merits.!47 Prejudice
is deemed to be ‘irreparable’ for the purpose of the indication of interim measures
if it makes impossible full execution of the judgment and full restoration of the
position of the party seeking preservation of its rights.148 This test has been inter-
preted very restrictively by international courts and tribunals. For instance, in
Aegean Sea, Greece sought provisional measures to prevent Turkey from carrying
out seismic tests on the area of continental shelf in dispute. In its order denying

provisional measures, the ICJ held that the ‘alleged breach by Turkey... is one that
might be capable of reparation by appropriate means’, and it followed that the ICJ
was unable ‘to find in that alleged breach of Greece’s rights such a risk of irrepar-
able prejudice to rights in issue before the Court as might require the exercise of its
power under Article 41 of the Statute to indicate interim measures for their preser-
vation .!49 A similar finding was made by the Iran—US Claims Tribunal in /ran v
US (Case No B-1), where it held that ‘injury that can be made whole by monetary
relief does not constitute irreparable harm’.15° This was also accepted by the
ICSID Tribunal in Plama Consortium Ltd v Bulgaria, which accepted Bulgaria's
argument that ‘harm is not irreparable if it can be compensated for by damages,
which is the case in the present arbitration’.151

The jurisprudence of the ICJ demonstrates that the court does not require that
irreparable harm should seem certain, but that there should be a probability of
such prejudice.!5? In practice, the ICJ has generally indicated provisional meas-
ures in cases where events were certain because they had already taken place or on
the basis of events the occurrence of which in the near future could be regarded as
certain unless prevented by some diplomatic or judicial action.155

Tribunals having jurisdiction to grant provisional measures under UNCLOS
may do so to preserve the rights of the parties or to prevent serious harm to the
marine environment. With respect to the standard of harm, no guidance is given by
article 290 of UNCLOS or the constitutive instruments of the ITLOS and Annex
VII tribunals, and in its first three provisional measures orders, the [TLOS did not
expressly adopt the standard of ‘irreparable damage’ .!54 In Land Reclamation, how-
ever, the ITLOS directed Singapore ‘not to conduct its land reclamation in ways
that might cause irreparable prejudice to the rights of Malaysia or serious harm to
the marine environment’, thereby adopting this standard.1>> Yet even prior to this

order for provisional measures, parties had treated this standard as relevant. In M/V
Saiga (No 2), counsel for St Vincent and the Grenadines submitted that provi-
sional measures were necessary ‘to prevent further irreparable harm’.!5° In the
request for provisional measures before the IYLOS in MOX Plant, Ireland submit-
ted that there was a ‘serious and imminent danger of irreparable harm to Ireland’s
rights and of serious harm to the marine environment’,!°7 and the UK agreed that
the required standard was that of irreparability.!58 More significantly, the UNC-
LOS tribunal in MOX Plant expressly noted the relevance of IC] jurisprudence to
requests for provisional measures under UNCLOS:

Although the language of article 290 is not in all respects identical to that of article 41 of
the Statute of the International Court of Justice, the Tribunal considers that it should have
regard to the law and practice of that Court, as well as to the law and practice of ITLOS, in
considering provisional measures. 1>?

It also explicitly accepted the requirement of irreparable damage in applications
for provisional measures under UNCLOS:

International judicial practice confirms that a general requirement for the prescription of
provisional measures to protect the rights of the parties is that there needs to be a showing
both of urgency and of irreparable harm to the claimed rights (see, eg, Certain Criminal
Proceedings in France, Order of 17 June 2003, paras 34—5.)16°

ICSID tribunals have also made express reference to the language of ‘irreparable
damage’ or ‘irreparable prejudice’ in granting provisional measures. In Plama
Consortium Ltd v Bulgaria, the ICSID Tribunal held that ‘[t]he need for provisional
measures must be... necessary to preserve the status quo or avoid the occurrence
of irreparable harm or damage’.!®! In Tokios Tokeles v Ukraine, the ICSID Tribunal
referred to ICJ jurisprudence, stating that ‘[t]he international jurisprudence on pro-
visional measures indicates that a provisional measure is necessary where the actions
of a party “are capable of causing or of threatening irreparable prejudice to the rights
invoked”’.162 In Cases Nos A4 and A15(I), the Iran-US Claims Tribunal, operating
under a modified version of the UNCITRAL Rules, also expressly adopted the stand-
ard of ‘irreparable prejudice’ set by the ICJ,!°> and the UNCITRAL Tribunal in
EnCana Corporation v Ecuador also adopted the test of ‘irreparable prejudice’ .1°4

142 A Common Law of International Adjudication

As for the practice of the IACHR, article 63(2) of the American Convention
expressly provides that the ACHR has the power to grant provisional measures
‘when necessary to avoid irreparable damage to persons’.!®> Provisional measures
orders typically include statements by the IACHR to the effect that ‘the purpose
of provisional measures... is to effectively protect fundamental rights, inasmuch
as they seek to avoid irreparable damage to persons’.1°° As regards the ECHR,
Rule 39 does not specifically mention the criterion of ‘irreparable damage’. But in
Mamatkulov, the ECHR stated that ‘any State Party to the Convention to which
interim measures have been indicated in order to avoid irreparable harm being
caused to the victim of an alleged violation must comply with those measures’.!97
From this statement it is not clear whether ‘irreparable harm’ is a precondition for
the granting of provisional measures, or a condition that determines whether
certain provisional measures granted by the ECHR are binding.!® In light of the
methodology employed by the ECHR of referring to the practice and case law of
other international courts to determine whether it had the power to order binding
provisional measures,!© it is suggested that the ECHR intended to follow the prac-
tice of other international courts, and that the probability of irreparable harm
should be considered a criterion for the granting of provisional measures. Irreparable
damage is also a prerequisite for the granting of interim relief by the UN Human
Rights Committee,!7° and the UN Committee against Torture.!7!

2. Urgency

The second substantive condition necessary for international courts to grant pro-
visional measures is that the requesting state must show that they are required as a
matter of urgency. ‘Urgency’ is not a requirement expressed in article 41 of the ICJ
Statute, but the ICJ Rules stipulate that a request for provisional measures ‘shall have
priority over all other cases’,!7* and that the ICJ ‘shall be convened forthwith for
the purpose of proceeding to a decision on the request as a matter of urgency’.!73

David Caron, Lee Caplan and Matti Pellonpaa, 74e UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules: A Commentary
(2006) 537, where the authors argue that the standard of ‘irreparable harm should not be applied
under the UNCITRAL Rules, and suggest that ‘the terms “grave” or “substantive” might be more
appropriate’. See also Oellers-Frahm, above n 149, 921, 939-40.

Power to Grant Provisional Measures 143

The criterion of urgency is an implicit requirement in any request for provisional
measures, and is closely connected with the requirement of irreparable damage; if
the request for the preservation of rights were not urgent, in the sense that the
probable damage were not irreparable, then it would be acceptable to wait until
such time as the court or tribunal is able to hear the dispute in full.!74 Parties
requesting provisional measures have consistently sought to persuade the ICJ that
the provisional measures they requested were urgently required,!7> and the ICJ
has regularly recognized ‘urgency’ as a substantive requirement of any request for
provisional measures, as expressed in its Order in Passage through the Great Belt:

[P]rovisional measures under Article 41 of the Statute are indicated ‘pending the final deci-
sion’ of the Court on the merits of the case, and are therefore only justified if there is
urgency in the sense that action prejudicial to the rights of either party is likely to be taken
before such final decision is given.17°

The temporal element of urgency is important; as the ICJ stated, provisional meas-
ures must be necessary as a matter of urgency pending the ‘final decision’.1”7 This
factor is significant before all international courts, although it differs in requests
for provisional measures under UNCLOS. Urgency is not an express criterion for
requests under article 290(1) of UNCLOS, which deals with requests made to the
same body that will have jurisdiction over the merits. In the case of requests made
under article 290(5) of UNCLOS, however, the tribunal seised of the provisional
measures request will have jurisdiction to grant such measures ‘[p]ending the con-
stitution of [the] arbitral tribunal to which the dispute is being submitted . .. if it
considers that prima facie the tribunal which is to be constituted would have juris-
diction and that the urgency of the situation so requires’.178

177 See Certain Criminal Proceedings in France, para 35 (ICJ, 2003), where the ICJ held that ‘there
is at the present time no risk of irreparable prejudice, so as to justify the indication of provisional meas-
ures as a matter of urgency’. This suggests that the temporal element relevant in provisional measures
applications is not necessarily ‘pending the final decision’, but ‘at the present time’, which recognizes
that parties can make subsequent applications for provisional measures. This has indeed occurred in
Application of the Genocide Convention, where Bosnia and Herzegovina made two requests for provi-
sional measures: [1993] ICJ Rep 3 and [1993] IC] Rep 325; and also in Pulp Mills on the River
Uruguay, where the CJ issued an order on provisional measures on 13 July 2006 in response to
Argentina's request, and a further request for provisional measures was made, albeit by Uruguay, on
29 November 2006, in response to which the IC] issued an Order on 23 January 2007: available at

178 UNCLOS, above n 1, art 290(5).
144 A Common Law of International Adjudication

Even though article 290(1) does not expressly mention a requirement of
urgency, individual judges and parties have treated urgency as a requirement for
the prescription of provisional measures under both articles 290(1) and 290(5). In
M/V Saiga (No 2), St Vincent and the Grenadines submitted that although there
were ‘certain differences between these two paragraphs textually’, these differences
were ‘essentially academic and ‘for all practical purposes that standards and the
tests they apply are the same’.!79 It was submitted that urgency was a requirement
of article 290(1),!8° a submission with which counsel for Guinea agreed.181

The ITLOS did not prescribe any provisional measures in that case, and did
not consider the question of urgency; the three other provisional measures cases to
come before the ITLOS have been applications under article 290(5), and urgency
was thus, in these cases, a statutory requirement.!82 But Judge Treves, in his sep-
arate opinion in Southern Bluefin Tuna, observed that:

The requirement of urgency is part of the very nature of provisional measures, as these
measures are meant to preserve the rights of the parties pending the final decision (article
290, paragraph 1 of the Convention) (emphasis in the original).!8

Indeed, the UNCLOS tribunal in WOX Plant explicitly accepted the relevance of
urgency in applications for provisional measures under UNCLOS.!84 It should be
noted, however, that there is one significant difference to the way in which urgency
is relevant in requests for provisional measures under article 290(1) and 290(5).
Under article 290(1), the provisional measures must be urgent for the preservation
of the parties’ rights—or the protection of the marine environment from serious
harm—pending ‘the final decision’. In the case of an application under article
290(5), however, the provisional measures must be urgent in the sense that they are
necessary pending the constitution of the tribunal which will decide the merits.
The term ‘urgency’ is not found in the text of the ICSID Convention; an
attempt to have a reference to urgency and imminent danger included in it was
defeated.18> However, as Professor Schreuer has argued, ‘provisional measures will
only be appropriate where a question cannot await the outcome of the award
on the merits’,!86 and ICSID tribunals have referred to the need for ‘urgency’ to
justify the recommendation of provisional measures.!87 Likewise, urgency is also a

3. Other Factors

In considering whether ‘circumstances’ require the granting of provisional meas-
ures, other factors may be relevant.!9! One factor which has been suggested is the
likelihood of the international court having jurisdiction over the merits of the
case,!9? but in light of the widely accepted test of prima facie jurisdiction, this is
no longer seriously considered. !93 A second factor suggested by some writers is the
prospect of the applicant’s success on the merits.!94 This issue was considered by
Judge Shahabuddeen in his separate opinion in Passage through the Great Belt,
where he concluded that ‘a State requesting interim measures... is required to
establish the possible existence of the rights sought to be protected’,!9> and
Professor Thirlway has also argued that the applicant must show a prima facie case
for the existence of the rights in dispute.19° This was certainly a consideration of
the ICJ in Passage through the Great Belt,19’ but while it may be accepted that the
applicant must be able to demonstrate the existence of the rights in question, the
suggestion that it must also establish that it would succeed on the merits is yet to
receive clear endorsement as a necessary criterion by the ICJ, or any other inter-
national court.!°8 A third relevant factor is the presence of activity on the inter-
national plane pertaining to the dispute.199 In two recent cases, action by the UN
Security Council arguably had an effect on the outcome of a request for provi-
sional measures. In Lockerbie, SC Resolution 748 played a significant role in the
ICJ’s holding that the rights of Libya could not ‘now be regarded as appropriate
for protection by the indication of provisional measures’,2°° and in DRC v
Uganda, the ICJ referred in some detail to SC Resolution 1304 (2000), indicating
that it had played some part in the ICJ’s decision to indicate provisional measures.?°!

Other relevant activity might include the existence of a regional peace process,?°?
or the negotiation of a ceasefire.2°3 Fourth, an order for provisional measures
should not prejudge any of the issues to be determined on the merits; in this sense,
it cannot represent an interim judgment.?°4 Fifth, international courts will often
be careful to take account of the equal distribution of burdens in an order for pro-
visional measures.” Finally, in accordance with their function in managing the
dispute, international tribunals might also take into account the need to prevent
the aggravation or extension of the dispute.?°°

C. Binding Quality of Provisional Measures

The constitutive instruments of international courts which expressly confer the
power to grant provisional measures do not always provide that such measures have
mandatory force. One constitutive instrument which does clarify the legal effect of
provisional measures granted under it is UNCLOS. Under article 290(1) and
290(5) of UNCLOS, the ITLOS and arbitral tribunals constituted under UNC-
LOS have the power to ‘prescribe’ provisional measures, and article 290(6) makes it
clear that states must ‘comply promptly with any provisional measures prescribed
under this article’.2°7 But the statutes of many other international courts do not
make similar provision. The question of whether provisional measures granted by
the ICJ were legally binding was for many years one of the more controversial ques-
tions in public international law, and the issue engendered an extensive litera-
ture.2°8 The uncertainty arose chiefly from the ambiguity of article 41 of the ICJ
Statute, which provides that the ICJ has the power to ‘indicate’ provisional measures

which ‘ought’ to be taken,?°? and that the parties and Security Council are to be
notified of the provisional measures which have been ‘suggested’.?1°

This uncertainty was finally resolved in LaGrand in 2001, where the ICJ held that
its provisional measures were binding.?!! In LaGrand, the ICJ construed article 41
in accordance with the principle of effectiveness in treaty interpretation, holding
that the purpose of provisional measures was ‘to prevent the Court from being ham-
pered in the exercise of its functions because the respective rights of the parties to a
dispute before the Court are not preserved’.?!? Accordingly, it followed that:

the power to indicate provisional measures entails that such measures should be binding,
inasmuch as the power in question is based on the necessity, when the circumstances call
for it, to safeguard, and to avoid prejudice to, the rights of the parties as determined by the
final judgment of the Court.?!3

While it is likely that the decision in LaGrand is simply an example of the ICJ
exercising its judicial functions in interpreting article 41 of the ICJ Statute, it
might be suggested that another force may also have been at play. This is the intro-
duction of inter-institutional competition into international adjudication. It
might be speculated, for instance, that the decision was motivated in part by a
desire for the ICJ to remain an attractive forum for cases involving requests for
provisional measures, especially in light of the recent creation of the ITLOS, and
the clear stipulations under UNCLOS that provisional measures granted by
the ITLOS and other UNCLOS tribunals would be binding.?!4 Indeed, when
Australia and New Zealand commenced the Southern Bluefin Tuna cases against
Japan in 1999, in which they requested provisional measures,?!> the IC] was one
of three possible fora for the dispute; the applicant states eventually chose to use
the UNCLOS dispute settlement mechanisms.?!¢ This choice might have been
partially motivated by the knowledge that if their request for provisional measures
were successful, any provisional measures prescribed under UNCLOS would have
binding effect; if the applicants chose to litigate before the ICJ, some uncertainty
would attend this question. In reaching its decision in LaGrand, the ICJ was cer-
tainly not unaware of this issue; in its Counter-Memorial, the United States had
argued that the ICJ’s provisional measures were not binding, and compared the
fact that provisional measures were ‘prescribed’ under UNCLOS, whereas they

were merely ‘indicated’ under the ICJ Statute.2!7 Accordingly, the possibility can-
not be dismissed that the ICJ’s holding in LaGrand was encouraged by the fear
that its case load might be lessened where cases might otherwise be referred to the
ITLOS owing to the persistent uncertainty over the binding nature of its provi-
sional measures.

There are, however, limitations to the impact of inter-institutional competition
on the emergence of the common law of international adjudication. There is no
objective or empirical evidence to substantiate the suggestion that it has had any
influence on the decisions of international courts. Further, even if this consideration
does play a role, the scope of its operation is limited to situations where international
courts have overlapping jurisdictions, such as, primarily, the ICJ, the I[TLOS, and
other UNCLOS tribunals. This consideration arguably does not play a part as
between many other international courts, due to their different jurisdictions.

The emergence of a common approach to the binding nature of provisional
measures can also be found in the jurisprudence of other international courts. In
Mamatkulov and Abdurasulovic v Turkey, for instance, a Chamber of the ECHR
overturned previous authority and held that interim measures indicated by it had
legal effect.218 In its judgment, the Chamber referred to the principle of effective-
ness in treaty interpretation, the evolutive approach, and also article 31(3)(c) of
the VCLT\2!9 In particular, with respect to article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT, the
ECHR held that the European HR Convention was to be interpreted ‘so far as
possible consistently with the other principles of international law’.2?° It noted
that other international courts had recently ‘stressed the importance and purpose of
interim measures and pointed out that compliance with such measures was neces-
sary to ensure the effectiveness of decisions on the merits’,22! and made consider-
able reference to the practice of the ICJ, the IACHR, and other international
human rights bodies.22 The ECHR concluded that states parties to which
interim measures had been indicated had to ‘comply with those measures and
refrain from any act or omission that will undermine the authority and effective-
ness of the final judgment’.2?3 In 2005, this decision was upheld by the ECHR’s
Grand Chamber, which likewise, by reference to the principle of effectiveness in
treaty interpretation, an evolutive approach, and article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT,2?4

made extensive reference to the practice of other international courts on the
granting of provisional measures.??>

The IACHR has also observed that compliance with provisional measures
is mandatory, and necessary to ensure the effectiveness of its decisions on the
merits.?26 In two orders granting provisional measures, it has also noted that states
parties to the American Convention were required to ‘comply in good faith (pacta
sunt servanda) with all of the provisions of the Convention, including those
relative to the operation of the two supervisory organs of the Inter-American
system .227 Other international human rights bodies have also ruled that their pro-
visional measures are binding, even those whose final reports are not binding, but
merely recommendatory. These include the UN Human Rights Committee?28 and
the Committee Against Torture.?29

It should be remembered, however, that the general rule that international
courts have the power to grant binding provisional measures does not apply if it is
inconsistent with a particular court’s constitutive instrument. This is arguably the
case, for instance, with regard to the ICSID Convention, which provides in article
47 that ICSID tribunals merely have the power to ‘recommend’ provisional meas-
ures.?30 Yet ICSID tribunals have still treated provisional measures as having some
legal relevance. First, tribunals have taken non-compliance with recommended
provisional measures into account in awards on the merits;?3! and, second, the
ICSID tribunal in Maffezini dramatically held that provisional measures granted
under the ICSID Convention did, in fact, have binding effect:

While there is a semantic difference between the word ‘recommend’ as used in Rule 39 and
the word ‘order’ as used elsewhere in the rules to describe the Tribunal’s ability to require a
party to take a certain action, the difference is more apparent than real.... The Tribunal
does not believe that the parties to the Convention meant to create a substantial difference
in the effect of these two words. The Tribunal’s authority to rule on provisional measures is
no less binding than that of a final award.?3?

It is suggested that this decision is incorrect. Regardless of the application of the
principle of effectiveness or the adoption of an evolutive approach to treaty inter-
pretation, the term ‘recommend’ should be properly understood as denoting a
decision which is exhortatory rather than mandatory. Nevertheless, this decision
has since been approved by two ICSID tribunals: first, the tribunal in Victor Pey
Casado, which made extensive reference to the reasoning of the IC] in LaGrand on
this issue,233 and second, the ICSID tribunal in Tokios Tokeles; this tribunal con-
firmed, as a ‘well-established principle laid down by the jurisprudence of ICSID tri-
bunals’, that provisional measures ‘recommended’ under the ICSID Convention
are binding.?34 These decisions thus represent a dramatic example of how com-
mon features in the practice of international courts with respect to a procedural
issue can do more than merely fill a gap or influence the interpretation of an
ambiguous provision. Rather, a common practice with respect to a question of
procedure can even prevail over a clearly expressed provision in a constitutive
instrument, such as that in article 47 of the [CSID Convention.

D. Power to Grant Provisional Measures
Ultra Petita or Proprio Motu

The scope of the power to grant provisional measures is another aspect of the exam-
ination of common features in the exercise of the power. International courts gen-
erally consider themselves empowered to grant provisional measures ultra petita, or
measures other than those which are requested, and have included such provisions
in their rules of procedure.23> Even if an international court does not have such a
provision in its rules of procedure, it is suggested that all international courts have
an inherent power to grant provisional measures u/tra petita.?3° There are two justi-
fications for this. Firstly, while the xe ultra petita rule restricts international courts
to considering issues put forward by the parties in dispute, it does not restrict the
manner in which international courts resolve those issues in dispute. An inter-
national court has ‘the freedom to select the ground upon which it will base its
judgment’.?37 Secondly, international courts are deemed to know the law (jura
novit curia) and are not limited to the arguments put forward by the parties.?38

Power to Grant Provisional Measures 151

Finally, there is substantial practice of international courts granting provisional
measures other than those requested. Parties often present their requests in very
detailed terms, and international courts often only grant interim relief in part.?5°
A separate question is whether international courts can grant provisional meas-
ures of their own motion, without there being any request at all (proprio motu). As
with the power to grant provisional measures ultra petita, the rules of procedure of
many international courts expressly confer this power.24° As the exercise of this
power is connected with the function of the international court in safeguarding its
jurisdiction or ensuring that any judgment which it gives on the merits would be
effective, it is suggested that all international courts can exercise this power proprio
motu, unless to do so would be inconsistent with their constitutive instruments.

Conclusion

This chapter has reviewed the practice of international courts concerning the
granting of provisional measures. It has suggested that international courts possess
this power as an express power or one which can be implied from the text of the
constitutive instrument, or as an inherent power, in the absence of agreement to
the contrary. Importantly, international courts have made extensive reference to
the jurisprudence of other international tribunals in exercising their powers over
provisional measures. This has led to substantial common features in the granting
of such measures; this even relates to issues which appear to be regulated by the
express terms of constitutive instruments, such as the question concerning the
binding nature of provisional measures under the ICSID Convention. The next
chapter turns to a consideration of the level of commonality in the exercise by
international courts of two post-adjudicatory powers; the power to interpret and
the power to revise judgments.
