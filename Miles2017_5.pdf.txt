Purpose of Provisional Measures

I Introduction

Provisional measures, as a general rule, may only be ordered to advance
certain defined objectives.' Two categories of measure exist. The first are
provisional measures designed to protect a right subject to litigation. The
second are provisional measures designed to prevent the further aggrava-
tion of the dispute and damage to the status quo more generally — referred
to here as measures for the non-aggravation of the dispute. However,
these seemingly simple categories conceal a wealth of corollaries that have
invited considerable judicial and academic commentary.

This chapter will address these corollaries, and critique the various
elaborations that they have prompted in the courts and tribunals under
investigation. As with the questions of jurisdiction and admissibility
examined in Chapter 4, the ICJ may be said to have led the way in
developing these elaborations — though other international bodies have
consistently adopted them for their own use. Moreover, that in the wake
of the ICJ’s determination as to the binding quality of provisional mea-
sures in LaGrand,* the Court has arguably been seeking to impose further
restrictions on the award of interim relief so insulate itself from frivolous
or vexatious applications and to enhance the legitimacy of any relief so
awarded. Three advances may be identified, namely the (re-)discovery
of the so-called ‘plausibility’ and ‘link’ tests and the further require-
ment that measures for the non-aggravation of the dispute may only
be awarded in the presence of measures for the protection of a right or
interest.

MEASURES FOR THE PRESERVATION OF RIGHTS PENDENTE LITE 175

II Measures for the Preservation of Rights Pendente Lite
A Different Forms of the Measure

The dominant reason for which most provisional measures are awarded
is to protect a right pendente lite. This much is evident in the wording
of Article 41 of the ICJ Statute and its PCIJ predecessor,* which speak of
provisional measures ‘which ought be taken to [p]reserve the respective
rights of the parties.” Substantially similar wording may be seen to appear
in, inter alia, UNCLOS Article 290(1), Article 47 of the ICSID Convention,
NAFTA Article 1134 and DR-CAFTA Article 10.20.8. This purpose has
been further confirmed judicially. The PCIJ, speaking through the pen of
President Huber in the Sino-Belgian Treaty case, noted that ‘the object
of interim measures of protection is to preserve the respective rights of
the Parties, pending the decision of the Court’® A similar approach was
taken by the ICJ in the Fisheries Jurisdiction cases, where it was said that
‘the right of the Court to indicate provisional measures [...] has as its
object to preserve the respective rights of the Parties pending the decision

of the Court,’ a position which has been reaffirmed as recently as Certain
Documents and Data.® Confirmation on this point has also been provided
by ITLOS? and by investor-state’® and inter-state arbitral tribunals."

It is worth noting that the broad wording of the phrase ‘preservation
of rights pendente lite’ actually conceals within it a number of other mea-
sures. These do not have a separate life of their own, but may instead
be seen as expressions of the wider general purpose. Notwithstanding its
pronouncement on the primary purpose of interim relief in the Fisheries
Jurisdiction and other cases, the ICJ in Aegean Sea stated that “[t]he essen-
tial object of provisional measures is to ensure that the execution of a
future judgment on the merits shall not be frustrated by the actions of
one party pendente lite.!* Such measures of non-anticipation however, are
still considered to relate to the preservation of rights, as such anticipation
may “prejudice the rights claimed |... ] and affect the possibility of their
full restoration in the event of judgment in [the applicant’s] favour’.°

B_ Defining a Right Pendente Lite

In all cases considered, a court or tribunal’s jurisdiction to indicate provi-
sional measures is enlivened only in the context of the case before it, and
‘does not comprise a power to protect rights “at large” on the application
of a State which considers that its rights are threatened’.'* Consequently,
when considering measures for the preservation of rights, the right or

interest in question is generally defined by the assertions in the appli-
cant’s originating process.!° Thus, in the Fisheries Jurisdiction cases it was
said that ‘irreparable prejudice should not be caused to the rights which
are the subject of dispute in judicial proceedings’.'* In Bosnian Genocide,
it was similarly found that ‘the Court must be concerned to preserve by
such measures the rights which may subsequently be adjudged by the
Court to belong either to the Applicant or to the Respondent’! More
expansively, the ICSID tribunal in Plama v Bulgaria remarked that:

The rights to be preserved must relate to the requesting party’s ability to
have its claims and requests for relief in the arbitration fairly considered
and decided by the arbitral tribunal and for any arbitral decision which
grants to the Claimant the relief it seeks to be effective and able to be
carried out. Thus the rights to be preserved by provisional measures are
circumscribed by the requesting party’s claims and requests for relief.'*

The existence of such rights, moreover, is conditioned by the court or
tribunal’s previous determinations on jurisdiction, or, where jurisdiction
has not been finally determined, its findings on prima facie jurisdiction.
Thus, in Bosnian Genocide, the IC] considered a request for provisional
measures where the only basis of jurisdiction that survived a prima facie
examination was the Genocide Convention. Consequently, the Court was
only willing to award relief that protected those rights, whilst dismissing
requests pertaining to other interests, e.g. self-defence.”

Where the claimant applies for provisional measures, the rights to be
preserved are easily identified from the pleadings. However, provisional
measures can be requested by both parties to the dispute. The question
therefore arises as to how to identify the rights to be protected where the
respondent is applying for interim relief in the absence of a counterclaim
that might specify the rights that it seeks to assert.” This problem con-
fronted the ICJ in the second set of provisional measures proceedings in

the Pulp Mills case.”' In broad terms, the case concerned the construction
and future commissioning of two pulp mills on the Uruguayan side of the
River Uruguay, which partially demarcated the border with Argentina.
Argentina founded jurisdiction on the 1975 Statute of the River Uruguay,
which provided that ‘any dispute concerning the interpretation and appli-
cation of the [Montevideo] Treaty [concerning the boundary constituted
by the River Uruguay] and the [present] Statute which cannot be settled by
direct negotiations may be submitted by either party to the International
Court of Justice.” It further requested an award of provisional measures
to protect the rights specified in its application, but this was eventually
denied by the Court on the basis that there was no risk of irreparable
prejudice.”°

Shortly thereafter, Uruguay filed its own request for interim relief to
restrain certain Argentine citizens from blocking roads and bridges over
the river to protest the construction of the mills. In making this applica-
tion, Uruguay conceded that these acts fell outside of the Court’s juris-
diction inasmuch as they were not covered by the Statute of the River
Uruguay, but further contended that they constituted a fundamental
interference with the very rights that it was attempting to defend, ice.
its ability to construct and commission the pulp mills. As such, it was
said, ‘[t]he blocking of international roads and bridges [...] is a matter
directly, intimately and indissociably related to the subject matter of the
case before the Court.*4 The Court agreed, noting that

Article 41 of the Court’s Statute authorizes it ‘to indicate [...] any provi-
sional measures which ought to be taken to preserve the respective rights
of either party’; and [...] the rights of the respondent are not dependent
solely upon the way in which the applicant formulates its application[.]”°

The point, the Court continued, was not that Uruguay was able to seek
interim protection of any right that could be claimed under international
law, but rather that in defending the proceeding it was asserting a right
to construct and commission the mills without interference by another
state. Put this way, the Court held:

[A]ny right Uruguay may have to continue the construction and to begin
the commissioning of [the pulp mills] in conformity with the provisions

of the 1975 Statute, pending a final decision of the Court, effectively
constitutes a claimed right in the present case, which may in principle be
protected by the indication of provisional measures.”°

To elaborate, had the proceedings been instituted by Uruguay asking
for a declaration that the construction of the mills conformed to the
1975 Statute, then any attempt to impede that construction by Argentina
through the blockading of bridges could validly be the subject of interim
relief?’ Accordingly, where provisional measures are requested by the
respondent in the absence of a counterclaim, the rights to be protected
are a negative image of the claimant’s application, in that the respondent
may assert a right to pursue a course of conduct over the objections of the
claimant. This may be seen as a reflection (of sorts) of the PCI)’s dictum
in the SS Lotus case,?> where was said that international law does not,
absent a prohibitive rule to the contrary, restrain the capacity of states to
commit acts that have effects beyond their territorial jurisdiction.

This point is of general application with respect to other courts and
tribunals, although it has yet to arise in quite so acute a fashion before
other institutions. An adjudicative body under UNCLOS Part XV has yet
to consider the question and on the rare occasion that a state respondent
in an investment arbitration has applied for provisional measures, the
basic rights to be defended invariably concern the power of that state to
regulate investment activity within its own borders,”’ even ifthe measures
requested do not directly seek to protect those rights.°°’

C Relationship Between Measures Requested and the Merits Proper

Simply remarking that provisional measures are intended to preserve
rights pendente lite, however, is to oversimplify the matter. Further

180 PURPOSE OF PROVISIONAL MEASURES

enquiries are required with respect to the connection between the mea-
sures requested and the final judgment on the merits. Within the jurispru-
dence, this has generated what might be referred to as the ‘link’ require-
ment, i.e. that the rights to be protected by the imposition of provisional
measures must be linked to those rights that are the subject of the main
claim.*! Given the fact-dependent nature of the requirement, it can only
be assessed on a case-by-case basis — though some general principles may
be ascertained.

1 The International Court of Justice

Much of the early jurisprudence surrounding the link requirement
emerges, unsurprisingly, from the practice of the PCY] and ICJ. A relatively
straightforward instantiation of the problem arose in Arbitral Award of
31 July 1989, where the subject matter of the claim was the formal valid-
ity of an arbitral award determining the rights to certain maritime areas
between Guinea-Bissau and Senegal. As part of its request, Guinea-Bissau
asked the Court to order provisional measures with respect to activities
in the maritime areas themselves. This was rejected on the basis that:

[T]he Applicant [...] asks the Court to pass upon the existence and
validity of the award but does not ask the Court to pass upon the respective
rights of the parties in the maritime areas in question [... ] [A]ccordingly,
the alleged rights sought to be made the subject of provisional measures
are not the subject of proceedings before the Court on the merits of the
case.”

An earlier example occurred before the PCY in the Polish Agrarian Reform
case,*° a decision that also highlights the difficulties that may arise in the
ascertainment of the precise identity of rights sub judice.** In that case,
the German pleading’? was on its face unclear as to whether Germany

considered the entirety of the Polish agricultural reform legislation to be
inconsistent with Articles 8 and 9 of the Minorities Treaty,*° or whether it
was only concerned with certain specific instances of discrimination. The
PCIJ held that the latter was the correct interpretation of the pleading,
and as such, that:

[T]he interim measures asked for [concerning all future cases of the appli-
cation of the law] would result in a general suspension of the agrarian
reform in so far as concerns Polish nationals of the German race, and
cannot therefore be regarded as solely designed to protect the subject of
the dispute and the actual object of the principal claim.*”

This reading of the German pleading was questioned by Judge Anzilotti,
who preferred to interpret it as seeking a declaratory judgment that the
Polish government’s conduct in the application of the agrarian reform law
was generally inconsistent with the Minorities Treaty — consequently, the
case concerned more than just certain instances of alleged expropriation,
but rather ‘the whole body of acts by which the Polish authorities [had]
applied the agrarian reform law’ If this was the case, Judge Anzilotti
remarked, ‘it is quite comprehensible that [Germany] should have asked
[...] that the application of the agrarian reform to Polish citizens of the
German race, in general, should be suspended’.*® However, he continued,
Germany bore responsibility for the filing of a document ‘open to different
interpretations’ in relation to a matter with respect to which ‘perfect clarity
[was] essential’. As such, it was proper that relief be denied, but this did
not prevent the filing of a fresh application ‘indicating the subject of the
suit with the necessary clearness and precision, and to follow it up by a
fresh request for the indication of interim measures appropriate to the
rights claimed’?

It is possible to see the difficulties caused by the German pleadings
in the Polish Agrarian Reform case as informing, at least in part, the
1936 amendment of the PCIJ’s rules of procedure.*” There, paragraph 1
was introduced to the overhauled Article 61 (formerly Article 57 of the
Court’s 1931 Rules), requiring that any request for provisional measures

‘shall specify the case to which it relates and the interim measures of which
the indication is proposed’. This was in turn carried over to the ICJ’s 1946
and 1972 Rules.*! The 1978 Rules, however, dropped this requirement,
replacing it instead with the present requirement of Article 73(2) that the
request specify only the reasons behind it and the possible consequences
if relief were not granted. Oellers-Frahm attributes this shift to ‘the fact
that formalistic definitions are not always helpful and that the Court has
to assess the indication of provisional measures from the point of view
of the substance of the dispute as a whole.” Post-LaGrand, however,
the link requirement has attained renewed importance in the Court’s
jurisprudence, such that the diminution identified by Oellers-Frahm has
been partially reversed.** In Pulp Mills, the Court identified the link test
as an independent requirement in the provisional measures calculus, in
opposition to the Court’s previous position whereby the relationship
between provisional measures and the merits was considered implicitly
when assessing irreparable prejudice to rights in issue.** In the Border
Area case, the majority elevated the link between the measures sought
and rights pendente lite to a condition precedent for the award of relief.”

The Uruguayan application in Pulp Mills also gave the Court the oppor-
tunity to reconsider the contours of the link requirement, characterizing
the question as contemplating ‘the link between the alleged rights the pro-
tection of which is the subject of the provisional measures being sought,
and the subject of the proceedings before the Court on the merits of the
case’.*° The Court defined the threshold as one of ‘a sufficient connection
with the merits of the case for the purpose of the current proceedings.*” A
fortiori, it seems that the Court does not require precise equivalence
between the rights to be protected and the merits of the proceeding,*® but
merely that some relationship be observable:

MEASURES FOR THE PRESERVATION OF RIGHTS PENDENTE LITE 183

Whereas the first provisional measure requested by Costa Rica is aimed at
ensuring that Nicaragua will refrain from any activity ‘in the area compris-
ing the entirety of Isla Portillos’; whereas the continuation or resumption
of the disputed activities by Nicaragua on Isla Portillos would be likely to
affect the rights of sovereignty which might be adjudged on the merits to
belong to Costa Rica; whereas, therefore, a link exists between these rights
and the provisional measure being sought [.]*

Even this threshold has proved malleable, depending on the measures
requested and the wider circumstances of the case. In the consular rights
cases of Breard,°? LaGrand and Avena?! the rights subject to litigation
arose from the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (VCCR)** and
the failure of US authorities to inform foreign nationals being prose-
cuted of serious crimes of their right to consular assistance. The states
concerned — Paraguay, Germany and Mexico, respectively — asked that
the Court intervene to provisionally halt the execution of their citizens
so as to enable full reparation. These rights, however, were reflective of
the political subject matter of the dispute; its legal substance was bound
up entirely in the interpretation and application of the VCCR, a point
made by Judge Oda in repeated declarations.°? The same may be said of
the orders made in the Temple (Interpretation) case, in which the Court
was requested under Article 60 of its Statute to interpret the geographic
scope of an area that it had adjudged in an earlier decision to belong to
Cambodia.’ In ordering interim relief, however, the Court controver-
sially overstepped this mark, ordering the imposition of a demilitarized
zone that would on any reading of the original judgment impinge on the
sovereignty of either Thailand or Cambodia,” and which would therefore
be impossible to determine under the jurisdictional mandate granted to
the Court by Article 60.°° From this, one may draw the inference that
the possible consequences of a failure to award provisional measures will

against Russia, however, was bought in the context of a wider conflict in
which Russia invaded Georgia alleging persecution of a Russian-speaking
minority in the breakaway republics of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. The
true gravamen of the Georgian complaint, accordingly, was not racial
discrimination, but violations of international humanitarian law more
generally - CERD merely provided a basis on which to invigorate the
jurisdiction of the ICJ. Consequently, when ordering protection of rights
in dispute, the Court required to parties to, inter alia, ‘refrain from any
act of racial discrimination against persons, groups of persons, or institu-
tions, with the implication being (somewhat perversely) that any violation
of humanitarian law that was not based on racial discrimination would be
permissible under the terms of the order. That being said, the Court also
awarded measures for non-aggravation that would presumably capture
any wider breaches of the laws of war.°!

Furthermore, the link requirement has been reduced to the vanishing
point where a party requests a provisional measure designed to ensure
compliance with other forms of interim relief already granted, e.g. a mea-
sure requiring a party to keep the Court apprised of compliance with
its orders. Self-evidently, where specific measures have been awarded,
further measures to ensure compliance therewith require no further jus-
tification. The same may also be said of measures for non-aggravation
of the dispute, with respect to which the Court has applied a reduced
threshold on the basis that they ‘compliment’ rights that may fall for final
determination.™

2 Dispute Settlement Under UNCLOS

Although the jurisprudence of the IC] has — particularly in recent years —
given additional life and depth to the link requirement, the same level of
articulation did not until recently occur with respect to UNCLOS Article
290. That is not to say, however, that such a requirement could not be
inferred. Like Article 41 of the ICJ Statute, UNCLOS Article 290 pro-
vides that ‘the Tribunal may prescribe any provisional measures which it
considers appropriate under the circumstances to preserve the respective
rights of the parties to the dispute’®* Such considerations of ‘appropri-
ateness’ speak to a need for a link between the rights to be adjudicated
on the merits and the measures so requested — it just so happens that this
was subsumed within wider considerations as to irreparable prejudice,
the stance taken by the ICJ prior to Pulp Mills.

Earlier coyness notwithstanding, the Special Chamber of ITLOS con-
vened in Ghana/Céte d'Ivoire introduced the link requirement to UNC-
LOS Article 290(1). The case concerned the delimitation of a maritime
boundary between the two states, with Cote d'Ivoire seeking to restrain
hydrocarbon extraction overseen by Ghana in the disputed area. In this
connection, Cote dIvoire requested, inter alia, that the Chamber restrain
all oil extraction and exploitation operations in the disputed area, refrain
from granting any new permits pertaining to the same, and to take all
steps necessary to prevent information on exploitation activities in the
disputed area from being used to the detriment of Cote d'Ivoire.” In
assessing the prerequisites of interim relief, the Chamber simply held that
‘there is a link between the rights Cote d'Ivoire claims and the provi-
sional measures it seeks, citing the ICJ’s 2011 order in Border Area in
support.°’ On this basis, it may be said that the requirement is on its way
to becoming a prerequisite to interim relief under UNCLOS Article 290 —
although it should be pointed out that the Tribunal as a whole in Enrica
Lexie made no mention of it as a separate requirement.

the case before the Court on the merits, in so far as it is a measure complimenting more
specific measures protecting those same rights’.

°” Border Area, ICJ Reports 2011 p 6, 18. The reliance of the Special Chamber on ICJ authority
throughout the Order of 25 April 2015 is surprising in light of its past recalcitrance. It is
worth noting, however, that President Abraham of the IC] was appointed judge ad hoc by
Céte d'Ivoire, which may have led to a more catholic understanding of interim relief.

186 PURPOSE OF PROVISIONAL MEASURES

The above discussion notwithstanding, neither ITLOS nor an Annex
VII tribunal have seen fit to elaborate on what such a link might entail —
though at the present point in time there is no reason to think that it
will not proceed along lines identical to the ICJ. In part, this might be
thought to reflect the level of restraint demonstrated by parties who apply
for provisional measures in ensuring that — in terms of their pleadings at
least — their reach does not exceed their grasp. It might also be thought
to reflect the relatively narrow class of rights that UNCLOS tribunals
are competent to adjudicate upon per UNCLOS Article 288(1), which
lends itself to clear identification and the crafting of relief to match,
notwithstanding the fact that the Article 89(3) of the ITLOS Rules — like
Article 73(2) of the ICJ Rules on which it was based — does not require
the identification of rights to be protected in a request for interim relief.
A final consideration may be the fairly sparse reasoning that characterizes
ITLOS provisional measures. Unlike the ICJ, which has evidenced a steady
increase in the complexity of its decisions on provisional measures over
time, ITLOS has remained more aloof in its reasoning, and if it deems
a requested measure to be unrelated to the rights subject to litigation, it
is more likely to simply rewrite the request per its power to award relief
other than that requested by the parties, as opposed to simply addressing
and rejecting each request individually.

It should be added that provisional measures for the protection of the
marine environment, being the subject of express mention in UNCLOS
Article 290, need not fulfill the link requirement — they remain available
in all proceedings under Part XV, irrespective of the subject matter of the
dispute.

3 Inter-State Arbitration

The link test has also been averred to in the context of inter-state
arbitration. In Kishenganga, India argued that one of the four inter-
national criteria guiding the award of interim measures was that of ‘a
link between [the] rights [whose protection is being sought] and the
measures requested’.’ The Court of Arbitration to an extent disagreed,
citing the lex specialis nature of Paragraph 28 of Annexure G of the
Indus Waters Treaty”? as excluding by implication further additional

6 See e.g. the Irish pleadings in MOX Plant, where it was contended ‘that its rights under
certain provisions of the Convention, in particular articles 123, 192 to 194, 197, 206, 207,
211, 212 and 213 thereof, will be irrevocably violated’: MOX Plant (2001) 126 ILR 257,

requirements.’' However, the Court considered that one of the purposes
for which provisional measures could be awarded under Paragraph 28
of Annexure G, being ‘to safeguard [a party’s] interests under the Treaty
with respect to the matter in dispute’ could be usefully informed by the
practice of the ICJ concerning the phrase ‘to preserve the respective rights
of either party.” As such, the Court of Arbitration may have considered
the ICJ’s pronouncements on the link test in Pulp Mills and later cases
to be relevant to the interpretation of Paragraph 28. However, it did not
address the point, possibly due to the fact that an alternative basis for
interim action within the provision, ‘to avoid prejudice to the final solu-
tion of the dispute’ did not require an express consideration of rights
pendente lite, and thus no discussion of linkage.’* Accordingly, India’s
submissions that Pakistan’s application for interim relief failed for want
of alink between the measures sought and the merits”* went unaddressed.
Despite this, however, the Court confusingly saw fit to introduce a form
of preliminary merits review into Paragraph 28 of Annexure G, a test that,
as will be seen, requires identification and consideration of rights that fall
to be considered on the merits.”

4 Investor-State Arbitration

A different narrative, however, emerges with respect to investor-state arbi-
tration. Investment arbitration tribunals have become used to rejecting
requests for interim relief due to a failure to demonstrate an appropri-
ate link between the measures requested and the rights on the merits,
whilst at the same time setting a reasonable threshold for applicants in
this respect.”

(a) ICSID Arbitration The ICSID Rules are alone amongst the tri-
bunals surveyed in requiring that the rights in question be specified in the
request for provisional measures.’’ Consequently, ICSID tribunals have
stated that such rights must exist at the time that the request is made,
must not be hypothetical and cannot be created in the future.’”® Impor-
tantly, tribunals have considered that rights accruing to investors under

domestic contracts are enforceable where the contracts in question are
directly actionable.”

Article 47 of the ICSID Convention seems to confine relief to rights
subject to litigation, i.e. those that are included in the investor’s prayer
for relief or the directly corresponding sphere of state activity.®° This
reading of the provision is reflected in the early ICSID jurisprudence.
In Amco v Indonesia, the Tribunal was confronted with a request by
the respondent to enjoin the claimant from violating the confidentiality
of the arbitral proceedings through a series of newspaper articles. The
request was rejected for two reasons: in the first place, the articles in
question could not have harmed Indonesia’s interests; and in the second,
the confidentiality of the proceedings was not a right which fell to be
determined on the merits. The Tribunal noted:

[C]laimants rightly point out that Rule 39(1), implementing the very
general provision of Article 47 of the Convention, requires a party which
solicits a provisional measure to specify the rights that such measure would
be purported to preserve. Obviously, the rights to which this provision is
relating are the rights in dispute, and no such right could be threatened
by the publication of articles like those which are produced [...] It might
possibly be that a large press campaign could have [a negative effect on
Indonesia]. However, even so, it would not be an influence on rights in
dispute.*!

Over time, however, ICSID tribunals have moved away from this strict
standard. The Tribunal in Plama v Bulgaria rejected the Amco v Indonesia

See e.g. Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited v Independent Power Tanzania Ltd,
Provisional Measures (1999) 8 ICSID Reports 239, 242; City Oriente Ltd v Ecuador and
Empesa Estatal Petréleos Del Ecuador (PetroEcuador), ICSID Case No ARB/06/21 (Decision

§§134-7. There is no reason to think that a different result would follow with respect to
contractual rights if the rights to be determined on the merits derived from an investment
treaty.

8° See Churchill Mining v Indonesia, ICSID Case No ARB/12/14, $44, 50, holding that the
respondent’s general rights to (a) host foreign investments, (b) regulate and promote
investment in its natural resources, (c) enforce regulations on investment in its natural
resources, (d) be free from reputational attacks, and (e) attain justice based on factual truth
could not be considered subject to litigation. The Tribunal reached a similar conclusion
regarding the respondent’s second requested order, namely that the claimant’s personnel
be prevented from lobbying Indonesian officials so as to achieve a settlement: ibid, §§51—-4.

standard as overly narrow, requiring instead that the rights to be protected
merely ‘relate’ to those to be determined on the merits.®* This is now the
status quo, with the tribunals apparently aware that they have developed a
variant of the link test that is at least partially distinct from ICJ practice.**

the right arises under Article 26 of the ICSID Convention, but surely exists more generally
in international law where the existence of parallel proceedings and the possibility of a
contradictory award would prejudice the effective resolution of the dispute: Charles N

§26. It is worth noting that confidentiality will not generally be considered a right related
to a right pendente lite (per Amco v Indonesia and Churchill Mining v Indonesia), but
where a breach of confidentiality is sufficiently severe it may be elevated to that level
through its ability to affect those rights substantially and directly, e.g. by damaging an

provision ofa financial guarantee or bond,** none of which will ordinar-
ily appear in or thrown into relief by the claimant’s originating process.
Furthermore, they do not appear to have been considered expressly by
the drafters of the ICSID Convention in relation to provisional measures,
leading to concerns of legitimacy.®’ But that is not to say that procedural
rights cannot be protected through provisional measures: the problem
is not one of the scope of Article 47 and Rule 39(1), respectively, but of
the identification of the rights to be protected. The preferable approach
is that utilized by the tribunal in RDC v Guatemala, which characterized
a request for the preservation of evidence as either designed to preserve
the substantive rights of the parties or to ensure that its jurisdiction was
fully effective, a classification reflected in DR-CAFTA Article 10.20.8.7°
Put another way, arbitral proceedings are commenced in order to uphold
substantive rights, and anything that prejudices such proceedings (e.g. the
destruction of evidence) will necessarily cause prejudice to the rights on
which they are premised. In this sense, the protection of procedural rights
is a necessary corollary of the need to protect the actual rights pendente
lite, which is the approach taken by the ICJ on those rare occasions where
it is petitioned for measures of protection relating to the protection of
evidence.”! The PCIJ exhibited a similar practice with respect to mea-
sures to protect the exclusivity of proceedings. In Electricity Company, the
Court ordered Bulgaria to ensure that, pending the proceedings before

as to ‘prevent [...] the performance of acts likely to prejudice [...] the

respective rights which may result from the impending judgment.”

(b) UNCITRAL Arbitration Tribunals operating under the UNCI-
TRAL Rules (or variants thereof) have displayed propensities similar to
those of ICSID tribunals. The Iran—US Claims Tribunal in particular rec-
ognized the need for a connection between the measures proposed and
the subject matter of the litigation and was particularly willing to take
action in order to protect the exclusivity of proceedings.”* As stated by
the Iran—US Claims Tribunal in E-Systems v Iran:

The Tribunal has an inherent power to issue such orders as may be nec-
essary to conserve the respective rights of the Parties and to ensure that
this Tribunal’s jurisdiction and authority are made fully effective. Not only
should it be said that the award to be rendered in this case by the Tri-
bunal [...] will prevail over any decisions inconsistent with it rendered
by Iranian or United States courts, but, in order to ensure the full effective-
ness of the Tribunal’s decisions, the Government of Iran should request
that actions in the Iranian Court be stayed until such proceedings in this
Tribunal have been completed.”

However, the Iran—US Claims Tribunal retained an awareness of the need
to protect only the subject matter of the proceedings before it. In RCA
Globcom v Iran, the claimant based its claim on a contract for services with
the Iranian Army Joint Staff, and further asserted that the contract was
subsequently cancelled due to force majeure. The claimant had, however,
taken out an insurance policy on the contract with a third party insurer.
Following the contract’s putative cancellation, the insurer had pursued the
claimant in the Iranian courts for premiums post-dating the frustrating
event, and secured judgment in its favour. The Tribunal refused to award
provisional measures for the vacation of the judgment on the basis that
‘the proceedings before the domestic court concern a dispute arising

out of a separate contract’ (i.e. the insurance policy), and ‘[t]he alleged
interrelationship between the two cases is not quite clear’.”°

There is, however, a further elaboration in the case of UNCITRAL
tribunals. Article 26(1) of the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules only requires a
connection between interim relief and the subject matter of the dispute,
as opposed to rights subject to litigation.”° This results in a discretion
wider than that afforded to the other tribunals considered.”” As such,
when establishing the parameters of interim relief, UNCITRAL tribunals
have shown a propensity to phrase the link in terms of a general situa-
tion, as opposed to specific rights. In Paushok v Mongolia, for example,
the Tribunal recited the various provisions of the relevant BIT on which
the claimant relied, but characterized the situation more generally as
relating to ‘the validity under the [BIT] of the Windfall Profit Tax and
of the levying of a fee for the import of foreign workers imposed by
the Respondent’.”® A similar picture emerges with respect to two of its
decisions on interim measures given in Chevron v Ecuador. There, the
situation involved Ecuador’s repeated failure to stay proceedings before
its domestic courts (the Lago Agrio judgment) and later, to prevent the
enforcement of a final judgment arising out of those proceedings. In its
Order of 28 January 2011, the Tribunal noted that the proceedings were
such as to potentially ‘render these arbitration proceedings inefficacious
[...] thereby thwarting the Claimant’s claims against the Respondent;
indicating that its concern was to prevent damage the claimant’s ability to
protect its interests via arbitration.””? Similar concerns may have been at
play in its Fourth Interim Award, wherein the Tribunal referred to the pos-
sibility that the Lago Agrio judgment would ‘imperil to a very significant
extent the overall fairness and the efficacy of these arbitral proceedings’
Ultimately, however, the Tribunal’s refusal to detach questions of linkage
from that of irreparable prejudice may indicate that they saw the two as
inextricable, a position redolent of earlier ICJ practice.

Significantly, Article 26(2) of the 2010 UNCITRAL Rules removes com-
pletely any requirement for linkage, at least on the face of the provision.
This, together with the work of the UNCITRAL Working Group on secu-
rity for costs, has caused some scholars to argue that the link test cannot
be reintroduced to the provision via implication.'®' However, given that
ICSID tribunals have managed to maintain the viability of security for
costs whilst still upholding some form of link requirement, it cannot be
said that such a precondition remains out of the question, especially given
its omnipresence before other international bodies.

D_ Plausibility of the Rights Claimed and the Prospect of Success
on the Merits

Connected to the question of the relationship between the rights subject
to litigation and the merits is the question of the existence of the rights
themselves and the additional question of the claimant’s likely success on
the merits. Within domestic legal systems, it is not uncommon for interim
relief to depend on the applicant’s capacity to demonstrate at least some
possibility of victory if the matter proceeds to final judgment.’ The
precise degree of success required may vary. In England, the position
is that the claimant must show that there is a serious question to be
tried,' in that the claimant must show that there is a real (as opposed to
a fanciful) prospect of success on the merits.'™ In civilian jurisdictions,
such as Germany’ or Spain,'°° a more stringent standard of the fumi
boni juris (literally: smoke of a good fire) may be applied so as to require
a reasonable probability of success on the merits. In the United States, the

194 PURPOSE OF PROVISIONAL MEASURES

Within the international space, a preliminary consideration of the mer-
its is problematic, due primarily to the consensual character of jurisdic-
tion. In cases where the jurisdiction of an international court or tribunal
is contested, the adjudicator must tread carefully so as to avoid giving the
impression that it is pronouncing on the merits without first establishing
its competence to do so —such speculation, Rosenne notes, ‘is hardly com-
patible with the international judicial function’? On the other hand, as
Collins points out, if no regard whatsoever is paid to the merits, this may
act as an incentive for parties to bring frivolous or vexatious claims in the
hope of securing interim relief.!°? Furthermore, per Oellers-Frahm, in
the event that success on the merits is totally improbable, then it follows
a fortiori that provisional measures cannot be deemed necessary for the
protection of rights pendente lite.'!° It might further be added that, to
the extent that a preliminary assessment of the merits may be criticized,
those criticisms do not differ markedly in substance from those leveled
at the test of prima facie jurisdiction when it was first introduced by
the Court — criticisms that were notably absent by the time that prima
facie admissibility was formally incorporated into the Court’s calculus.!!
As such, the clientele of international courts and tribunals appears to
have accepted the notion that the integrity of the provisional measures
process — especially in light of the common consensus that such measures
are binding — requires some examination of matters that are yet to be
determined finally, including the merits.

Accordingly, it is clear that some species of review is required — the ques-
tion is one of threshold. Two broad standards have emerged as between
international courts and tribunals. The first is broadly similar to standards
seen in municipal law and elsewhere in the international system (e.g. with
respect to preliminary assessment of jurisdiction): an assessment of the
applicant’s chances of success on the merits. The second is a lesser thresh-
old that seeks only to establish the ‘plausible’ existence of the rights with
respect to which interim protection is claimed.!”

only relatively recently within the Court’s practice. In Great Belt, Den-
mark argued that in order for provisional measures to be granted, a
reasonable prospect of success on the merits had to be demonstrated.
It further asserted: ‘not even a prima facie case exists in favour of the
Finnish contention.!!? Although the Court did not take a clear posi-
tion on the issue (instead holding that the Finnish application failed for
lack of urgency!'*) Judge Shahabuddeen considered the point at length,
eventually holding that:

[J]urisdiction over the merits is merely one element which the applicant
must establish in order to succeed in the substantive case which it has
brought — a truth undiminished, in my view, by the importance of that
element or by the fact that it may be argued as a preliminary issue. If the
claimant cannot make out a prima facie case of substantive jurisdiction,
this circumstance shows it has no possibility of succeeding. It is easy
to appreciate that proof of the definitive existence of the right claimed
cannot be part of the ‘circumstances’ within the meaning of Article 41 of
the Statute, but is rather a matter for the merits. It is less easy to accept
that this applies to the establishment of a possibility of the existence of the
right,!!

Further express consideration of the issue by way of separate opinion
occurred in the Pulp Mills. Although the majority again failed to comment
expressly on the point, Judges Bennouna and Abraham considered the
issue at length. Judge Bennouna argued that the majority ought to have
examined at least the existence of the rights sub judice whilst at the same
time taking all necessary precautions to ensure that it could not be accused
of having prejudged the merits of the case. He acknowledged, however,
that ‘it would not have been appropriate to settle the issue, even prima
facie if doubt subsisted as a result of the possible complexity, ambiguity or
silence of the texts concerned [ ... ] making it impossible to decide at this
stage between the Parties’ differing interpretations’.''© A more expansive
discussion was entered into by Judge Abraham, who argued that following
the determination in LaGrand that provisional measures ordered by the
ICJ were binding, the Court was obliged to enhance the legitimacy of such
interventions:

[The Court] cannot order a State to conduct itself in a certain way simply
because another State claims that such conduct is necessary to preserve
its own rights, unless the Court has carried out some minimum review to

determine whether the rights thus claimed actually exist and whether they
are in danger of being violated — and irreparably so — in the absence of the
provisional measures the Court has been asked to prescribe: thus, unless
the Court has given some thought to the merits of the case.!"”

Judge Abraham then went on to note that in undertaking such a limited
examination of the merits, ‘the Court does not overstep the boundaries
of its mission as a jurisdiction appealed to for final relief [but] on the
contrary, it is sensibly fulfilling that mission’ In such a light, the neces-
sity of merits review ‘is inescapable, mandated as it were by logic. The
judge stopped short, however, of requiring an ‘exacting’ evaluation of the
claimant’s prospect of success on the merits. Rather, he said,

It might be enough to ascertain that the claimed right is not patently
non-existent and that, according to the information available to the Court
at the particular stage in the proceedings, the possibility of the other
party’s conduct infringing that right is not manifestly to be ruled out. The
requirement of fumus boni juris then gives way to that of fumus non mali
juris. But, in all honesty, these are subtleties and there exists a great range
of intermediate degrees, each capable of expression in somewhat vague
terms: the requesting party should establish the possible existence of the
right claimed, or the apparent existence of such right, etc.'!®

It should be noted that although these separate opinions appear relatively
late in the Court’s jurisprudence, threads of the debate can be seen in
earlier commentary. With respect to the PCJ, Dumbauld argued that ‘a
prima facie showing of probable right and probable injury’ was a pre-
requisite of interim relief,'!? with Mani making a similar identification
with respect to the practice of the ICJ in the 1970s.'*° In Anglo-Iranian
Oil, the Court itself gave the somewhat Delphic statement that ‘the Court
must be concerned to preserve by such measures the rights which may
be subsequently adjudged by the Court to belong either to the Appli-
cant or to the Respondent’! Similarly, in the Nuclear Tests cases, Judges
Forster, Petrén and Ignacio-Pinto expressed serious doubts as to the legal
foundations of Australia and New Zealand’s claims against France when

dissenting from the majority decision to award provisional measures.”
Accordingly, whilst the recent focus of the ICJ on the elaboration of this
requirement might appear sudden, the threads of the debate are clearly
visible within the Court’s earlier practice, contrary to the assertions of
Judge Koroma in Border Area that the criterion “seemed to appear out of

nowhere’ !”?

(b) Further Development and Scope: 2009 Onwards Judge Abraham’s
powerful distillation of the issues in Pulp Mills appears to have influenced
the Court as a whole. In Obligation to Prosecute or Extradite, the Court
provided, pursuant to Article 41, that ‘the power of the Court to indicate
provisional measures should be exercised only if the Court is satisfied that
the rights asserted by a party are at least plausible.'** This formula — along
with the rider that the Court is not called upon to determine during the
provisional measures phase whether such rights exist — has been adopted
in subsequent cases, including Border Area,'*? Temple (Interpretation)'*°
and Certain Documents and Data.'*’

This recent string of decisions has enabled the Court to delineate the
boundaries of the test. In the first place, it is important to be clear that the
Court is not advocating a review of the applicant’s prospects of success on
the merits in the mode of municipal standards such as the serious ques-
tion to be tried or the fumi boni juris.'*® The Court is only purporting to
assess whether the applicant possesses the rights in question — it pointedly
does not assess whether, on the facts as they stand, those rights have been
breached by the respondent, much less whether that breach is excusable.
While some commentators have advocated a higher standard of review, '”?

the requirement of plausibility alone has become part of the settled prac-
tice of the Court and would appear to strike a satisfactory balance between
screening cases that are manifestly hopeless whilst at the same time giving
appropriate weight to the consensual character of international jurisdic-
tion. Whilst it might be argued that in refusing to pronounce on the
merits in a provisional sense, the Court deprives the parties of a “sneak
peek’ at the merits that might otherwise encourage settlement,'*° it is to
be remembered that the primary purpose of interim relief is not the facil-
itation of negotiations but the preservation of rights pendente lite. This
objective is better served if provisional measures are backed by an institu-
tional legitimacy achieved through awareness of the Court’s jurisdictional
boundaries.

Two criticisms have arisen with respect to the test as stated. The first
is that the plausibility criterion is not sufficiently separate from the link
test to be considered independent.'*! Although the two requirements are
closely aligned (in the sense that rights asserted must be both plausibly
held and sufficiently linked to the measures requested) the Court has
begun to structure its judgments such as to indicate a formal separation.
In the Temple (Interpretation) case, for example, the Court framed the
two tests in the following terms:

Whereas the power of the Court to indicate provisional measures under
Article 41 of the Statute has as its object the preservation of the respective
rights of the parties pending the decision of the Court; whereas it follows
that the Court must be concerned to preserve by such measures the rights
which may subsequently be adjudged by the Court to belong to either
party; whereas the Court may exercise this power only if it is satisfied that
the rights asserted by a party are at least plausible [... |

Whereas, moreover, a link must be established between the alleged rights
and the provisional measures sought to protect them.”

A second, more substantial criticism of the link test is that of ambiguity,
with Judge Koroma in Border Area noting that depending on the defini-
tion that one attributed to the term ‘plausible’, it could be held to bear

MEASURES FOR THE PRESERVATION OF RIGHTS PENDENTE LITE 199

the same meaning as ‘specious’ or ‘persuasive but deceptive’.'*° Such an
observation appears mildly fatuous — the criterion self-evidently attempts
to add materially to the existing prerequisites for the award of provisional
measures. But this does not detract from Judge Koroma’s wider point
that the threshold of plausibility is not immediately apparent in the test
as formulated. Nor is it clear whether the standard applies to legal rights
or facts or both.'** Insofar as the latter point is concerned, it is suggested
that some form of factual and legal analysis is required if the test is to be
effective. The Court must assess whether (a) the right asserted could pos-
sibly exist in the abstract; and (b) whether the party asserting that right
could plausibly hold it in the particular circumstances of the case. Thus,
in Border Area, the Court determined (a) that the contested territory, the
Isla Portillos, could plausibly be the subject of sovereign title; and (b) that
Costa Rica could plausibly hold such a claim — though the Court rightly
noted that it was not required to assess the plausibility of Nicaragua’s
alternative title.!°° The Court also did not purport to determine whether
Nicaragua had violated Costa Rica’s title and did not pronounce on the
presence (vel non) of any justification or excuse for such a violation.

But this still leaves the precise threshold of plausibility undefined.!*°
Oellers-Frahm has commented that to a German lawyer the term is redo-
lent of the concept of Schliissigkeit, meaning that the claim is ‘plausible’ if
supposing that the facts alleged by the applicant are true then the claim
will succeed.!°” However, such a position if true would conflate the plau-
sibility threshold with the kind of involved view of the merits that might
infringe on the jurisdictional limits that the Court has set for itself and
convert the proceedings into a summary trial on the merits. The prefer-
able position appears to be that of Judge Greenwood, who stated that in
order to satisfy the criterion, the applicant must demonstrate “something
more than assertion but less than proof; in other words |... ] that there
is at least a reasonable possibility that the right which it claims exists as a
matter of law and will be judged to apply to that party’s case’.!*®

Further clarity has been provided by the Court’s recent decision in Cer-
tain Documents and Data, which constitutes the first detailed application
of the test in the face of considered opposition by a respondent. There,

200 PURPOSE OF PROVISIONAL MEASURES

Timor-Leste sought to rely on a somewhat ambiguous set of rights arising
from Australia’s seizure of the relevant documents from Timor-Leste’s
solicitor in Canberra. In particular, it identified as worthy of protection
‘the ownership and property rights which it holds over the seized material,
entailing the rights to inviolability and immunity of this property [... |
to which it is entitled as a sovereign State, and its rights to confidentiality
of communications with its legal advisors’. Timor-Leste further sought to
argue that legal professional privilege could be considered a general prin-
ciple of law within the meaning of Article 38(1)(c) of the ICJ Statute.!*?
Australia, for its part, sought to challenge the plausibility of these rights
on both legal and factual grounds. In the first place, it was argued, it could
not be established that the documents that were removed from the solic-
itor’s office belonged to Timor-Leste. In the second, there did not exist
under international law a general principle of immunity or inviolability
of state papers and property and, even if there was, that principle could
not be considered absolute.'*°

This created a quandary for the Court. On the one hand, the Timo-
rese application was clearly novel, and to reject it without first subjecting
it to searching analysis would be premature. The case against rejection,
however, was weakened by the dearth of support for the argument in
Timor-Leste’s pleadings. The Court’s solution was to root the Timorese
submissions in a recognized principle of international law that was suf-
ficiently plausible. It began its analysis by identifying the factual context
in which the dispute arose (i.e. the PCA proceeding then on foot between
the parties under the TST'*') and the extent to which the documents
allegedly taken related to that arbitration. It then sought to link the rights
claimed by Timor-Leste — which were asserted with almost nothing in the
way of supporting authority!” — with an existing and recognized basis
in international law, namely that of sovereign equality, holding that it
was arguable that this principle extended to equality of arbitral process
and a right of states to expect that other nations would not interfere
in the preparations for and conduct of such proceedings.'*° This, the
Court said, ensured that at least some of the rights for which Timor-Leste

also Certain Documents and Data, Australia: Written Observations of 13 January 2014,

sought protection — ‘namely the right to conduct arbitration proceed-
ings and negotiations without interference [...] including the right of
confidentiality and of non-interference in its communications with legal
advisors’ — were plausible.'4

The Court’s approach in Certain Documents and Data raises a question
as to what would have occurred had a recognized international norm such
as sovereign equality not been available. In such a case, it is submitted,
the Court should still have found the test satisfied. Although novel, the
Timorese assertions were not totally fanciful, relying in part on widely
recognized principles of municipal law that could conceivably consti-
tute a general principle of law within the meaning of Article 38(1)(c) of
the ICJ Statute. In such a case, where a more searching investigation is
required to determine the plausibility of an applicant’s claims, the appli-
cant should axiomatically receive the benefit of the doubt in the same way
that investor-state arbitration tribunals presently treat similar claims as
to prima facie jurisdiction.'*° However, this is dependent on the applicant
to a certain extent helping itself — as pointed out by Judge Anzilotti in the
Polish Agrarian Reform case, it is not the Court’s job to correct manifestly
deficient pleadings. !*°

2 Dispute Settlement Under UNCLOS

On this basis, an articulated criterion of plausibility has now emerged as a
separate precondition for interim relief under Article 41 of the ICJ Statute.
The position under UNCLOS Article 290 was, for a time, less clear. Unlike
the ICJ, it seemed unlikely that any dispute settlement body convened
under UNCLOS Part XV will be required to consider whether a right exists
in a legal sense (as in Certain Documents and Data), as UNCLOS Article
288 expressly limits the jurisdiction of such bodies to disputes concerning
the interpretation or application of the Convention. Accordingly, if the
body in question determines that it possesses jurisdiction, it follows that
the right or rights claimed by the applicant are located within UNCLOS,
the legal existence of which is self-evident.'*” As such, if UNCLOS were
minded to adopt a plausibility criterion along the lines suggested by the
ICJ, the only relevant concern would be whether the applicant holds
the relevant rights as a question of fact, e.g. by being the registered flag

state of a vessel subject to allegedly improper seizure under UNCLOS, as
was asserted in M/V Saiga (No 2), M/V Louisa, ARA Libertad and Arctic
Sunrise.

This notwithstanding, ITLOS clearly considered the plausible existence
of rights claimed to be relevant to the grant of provisional measures since
at least 2010. In M/V Louisa, it noted that it did not need to ‘establish
definitively the existence of rights claimed’;!“° with the insertion of the
adjective ‘definitively perhaps implying that some form of review was
nonetheless required. Similar language was also used in ARA Libertad’?
and Arctic Sunrise.'°° As with the link requirement, the Special Cham-
ber in Ghana/Céte d'Ivoire finally introduced the plausibility requirement
expressly into the jurisprudence surrounding UNCLOS Article 290(1),
citing the ICJ’s 2013 order in Border Area’?! and holding in terms that
‘before prescribing provisional measures, the Special Chamber need not
therefore concern itself with the competing claims of the Parties [... ],
it need only satisfy itself that the right which Cote d'Ivoire claims on
the merits and seeks to protect are at least plausible’!°? This position
was then adopted — with reference to Ghana/Cote d'Ivoire — by the Tri-
bunal as a whole in Enrica Lexie.'°> On this basis, it may be said that
the requirement is now a prerequisite to interim relief under UNCLOS
Article 290.

A further consideration for ITLOS is the question of institutional legit-
imacy that arises from its regular use of UNCLOS Article 290(5) to award
provisional measures prior to the composition of an Annex VII arbi-
tral tribunal. As discussed earlier in relation to questions of prima facie
jurisdiction,’ the act of awarding interim relief on behalf of another
international tribunal may require that the claimant be given an addi-
tional benefit of the doubt when addressing issues that may later determine

India as respondent: ibid, $85. As pointed out by the dissenting Judge Heidar, this is
strictly speaking incorrect, with the purpose of the test being as a prerequisite for the
award of interim relief to the applicant. To apply it to the rights asserted by the respondent
is accordingly nonsensical. Indeed, in Enrica Lexie, India made no submissions as to
whether its asserted rights could be considered plausible: ibid, $§17—20 (Judge Heidar,
diss).

the claim — or at the least urge an additional measure of caution on the
part of the Tribunal.

As with the link test, provisional measures for the protection of the
marine environment are also exempt from the plausibility requirement.
The test assesses the existence of rights which are contested on the merits.
As the right to seek provisional measures arises not from the merits them-
selves, but from an express grant of power under the terms of UNCLOS
Article 290, the particular hoop need not be jumped through by the appli-
cant. In such situations, the true test is whether the serious environmental
harm hypothesized will actually come about — a question that arises in
relation to the requirements of irreparable harm and urgency.

3 Inter-State Arbitration

Those isolated instances of ad hoc inter-state arbitration appear minded
to adopt a form of merits review wholesale irrespective of whether a lex
specialis governs the award of interim relief. In Kishenganga, the Court of
Arbitration held that it was not required to import the linkage test into
its calculations due to the lex specialis of Paragraph 28 of Annexure G of
the Indus Waters Treaty.'°? This notwithstanding, the Court still held as
follows:

Yet as broad as the scope of Paragraph 28 may be, the Court nonetheless
recognizes that interim measures under the treaty remain an extraordinary
recourse. Consistent with the general practice of international and national
courts and tribunals, the Court must be satisfied that, without prejudice to
its decision on the merits, the claims set forth by the Party seeking interim
measures appear to be at least ‘plausible’. Regardless of the conditions
under which it is authorized under its rules to indicate interim relief, such
relief cannot be said to be ‘necessary’ under any of those conditions if it is
apparent to that court at an early stage that it is unlikely to have jurisdiction
or that the applicant has failed to present a plausible case on the merits.!*°

The Court then went on to apply this test to Pakistan, eventually
pronouncing itself satisfied that Pakistan had “presented a plausible,
provisionally tenable argument under the Treaty in support of its case’
and further remarked that it could not ‘exclude the possibility that
India’s planned installations, or elements of those installations, on the
Kishenganga/Neelum would not be in conformity with the [Indus River]

This passage suffers from certain difficulties similar. In an explanatory
footnote,'°® the Court linked the word ‘plausible’ to ‘terminology used by
the ICJ’ and cited the term as used in Temple (Interpretation). It then pro-
ceeded to note that ‘some jurisdictions would require the demonstration
of more than a plausible case, such as a prima facie determination that the
case is meritorious and cited Article 17A(1)(b) of the 2006 UNCITRAL
Model Law.!°? Given that the passage from Temple (Interpretation) that
the Court cited refers to the plausibility test as developed by the ICJ,'®° we
must assume that the Court in Kishenganga was referring to plausibility as
a threshold of preliminary merits review, and not proposing the adoption
of the IC)’s plausibility test wholesale. Moreover, based on its reference
to the 2006 UNCITRAL Model Law, the Court perceived plausibility as
entailing a threshold somewhere below that of the prima facie case.'*!

A further difficulty arises from the Court’s reliance on ‘the general
practice of international and national courts and tribunals’ in introducing
the ‘plausible case’ test. Whilst many national courts require some form
of merits review prior to the granting of interim relief, the previous
discussion demonstrates that the international scene is very different,
with courts and tribunals for the most part adopting some variation of
the IC)’s plausibility test.°* The inference to be drawn is that Kishenganga
is an attempt by the Court of Arbitration to advance the law on provisional
measures beyond the benchmark set by the IC] in Obligation to Prosecute
or Extradite and other cases in a manner redolent of Judge Lauterpacht’s
formulation of the test of prima facie jurisdiction in Interhandel.'©

MEASURES FOR THE PRESERVATION OF RIGHTS PENDENTE LITE 205

4 Investor-State Arbitration

The state of play with respect to investor-state arbitration is also con-
fusing, but for a different reason, namely that whilst the various ICSID
and ad hoc tribunals seem to agree that some form of merits review is
required prior to the award of interim relief, they cannot always agree on
the precise formulation of the test. Two schools of thought have emerged.
The first requires an inquiry into the existence of the rights with respect to
which protection is claimed. In Maffezini v Spain, the Tribunal determined
that the words ‘provisional measures for the preservation of [a party’s]
rights’ as they appeared in Rule 39(1) of the ICSID Rules required that
‘such rights must exist at the time of the request, must not be hypo-
thetical, nor [be] ones to be created in the future’.'®* This would appear
to require an ICSID tribunal to finally determine the existence of the
rights with respect to which protection is claimed at the provisional mea-
sures stage. These remarks were criticized by the Tribunal in Casado v
Chile, which pronounced them to be ‘susceptible to misunderstanding’
and unable to be upheld generally as they could require a tribunal to
prejudge the substance ofa case at a point at which it was ill-equipped to
do so.‘

Further currency was given to the views of the latter tribunal by their
adoption in Occidental v Ecuador. There, the claimant argued that it was
entitled to specific performance of an oil field concession agreement,
and sought provisional measures to this effect. The respondent, citing
Maffezini v Spain, asserted that under the applicable law of the arbitration,
the claimant was at best entitled to damages and that provisional measures
consequently could not be awarded on the basis that the claimed rights
were non-existent.!©° The Tribunal disagreed, observing that ‘although a
right may not yet have been recognized by the Tribunal, such a right may
nonetheless deserving of [interim] protection’.'®’ It was further noted
that if the respondent’s position was correct, a tribunal could never order
provisional measures to protect rights the existence and violation of which
was the precise subject matter of the arbitration.‘ Rather, relying on
Casado v Chile, it held that:

Republic, ICSID Case No ARB/06/5 (Provisional Measures, 6 April 2007) §§37—46.

206 PURPOSE OF PROVISIONAL MEASURES

The right to be preserved only has to be asserted as a theoretically existing
right, as opposed to proven to exist in fact. The Tribunal, at the provisional
measures stage, will only deal with the nature of the right claimed, not
with its existence or the merits of the allegations of its violation.!®

Elaborating on this, the Tribunal spoke of a need for a legally protected
right or interest (as opposed to a ‘mere interest’) to ‘potentially form
part of the Claimant’s individual rights and obligations’, indicating that
not only the right must exist in law, it must be held in fact by the party
that requests protection.'”? A similar position was taken by the ICSID
tribunal in Tethyan Copper v Pakistan, which required only that the
applicant establish ‘a prima facie case that it owns a legally protected
interest.!7!

These passages highlight two points. In the first place, rights do not
have to be definitively proved to exist in order to be protected — a mere
‘theoretical’ possibility of existence is sufficient.'’”? In the second, the
tribunals in question did not call for a review of the claimant’s prospects
of success on the merits. This position aligns with the plausibility test
developed by the ICJ, though no express parallel has been drawn.

The other school of thought which has developed in some investor-state
cases is that the applicant for interim relief must establish a prima facie
case on the merits if provisional measures are to be granted, a position
which has been advocated by Oellers-Frahm and others with respect to
the ICJ. Questions may be asked, however, as to whether such a test was
intended by the tribunals in question. In Paushok v Mongolia, the Tribunal
held as follows:

At [the provisional measures] stage, the Tribunal need not go beyond
whether a reasonable case has been made which, if the alleged facts were
proven might possibly lead the Tribunal to the conclusion that an award
could be made in favor of the Claimants. Essentially, the Tribunal needs
to decide only that the claims made are not, on their face, frivolous or
obviously outside the competence of the Tribunal. To do otherwise would
require the Tribunal to proceed to a determination of the facts and, in
practice, to a hearing on the merits of the case, a lengthy and complicated
process which would defeat the very purpose of interim measures.!”°

There are good reasons to doubt the accuracy of this passage, which cites
as authority the ICJ’s Order in Bosnian Genocide and the decision of the
ICSID tribunal in Casado v Chile, neither of which advocates a review
of the applicant’s prospects on the merits.'”* As such, it is possible that
the position set out in Paushok v Mongolia is based on a misreading
of earlier case law — similar in certain respects to the decision of the
Court of Arbitration in Kishenganga. This is by no means limited to the
tribunals themselves, with some scholars engaging in a similar misreading,
or mistakenly conflating the quasi-plausibility test set out in the line of
cases following Casado v Chile with a full prima facie review on the
merits.!”°

A further reference to the standard of the prima facie case was made
(without reference to any supporting authority) by the tribunal in
PNGSDP v PNG, with the test there held to comprise ‘a consideration
of the prima facie strength of the parties’ respective claims, counter-
claims and defences. At the same time, however, the Tribunal said that
‘{the] analysis should not pre-judge the merits of the case’ and that
the test would ‘ordinarily lead to a rejection |... ] only in rare circum-
stances, where the requesting party has failed to advance any credible basis
for its claims.'”° The Tribunal thus stipulated a relatively low thresh-
old of review at this stage of the proceedings, such that an applicant
would only seek to surmount it if its underlying claim was completely
incredible.

In this light, the position with respect to most ICSID and ad hoc
investor-state arbitrations is that something akin to the plausibility test
serves as a precondition to interim relief. The position may, however,
change in the future, with Article 26(3)(b) of the 2010 UNCITRAL Rules
requiring that the party seeking interim relief satisfy a tribunal that
there is ‘a reasonable possibility that the requesting party will succeed
on the merits of the claim’.!”” However, given that Article 26 of the 1976

UNCITRAL Rules does not contain this requirement and these Rules
remain the predominant set of procedural rules in ad hoc investor-state
arbitration, it is unlikely that any such shift will happen in the immediate
future.

III Measures for the Non-Aggravation of the Dispute
A_ Protection of the Objective Interest

In the context of the protection of rights pendente lite, provisional mea-
sures appear as a subjectively oriented tool of the parties, with interna-
tional courts and tribunals playing a purely reflexive role in assessing and
responding to specific applications. But courts and tribunals ought also
to consider the wider objective interest of the effective functioning of the
international judicial system. For this reason, international adjudicative
bodies are capable of protecting the administration of justice through the
granting of provisional measures proprio motu.'’® These often take the
form of measures expressed in terms of avoiding the aggravation or exten-
sion of a dispute'’? — referred to here as measures for the non-aggravation
of the dispute. An allied concern in this respect is the court or tribunal’s
interest in protecting the integrity of its proceedings, a point made by the
ICSID tribunal in Biwater Gauff v Tanzania as follows:

It is now settled in both treaty and international commercial arbitration
that an arbitral tribunal is entitled to direct the parties not to take any
step that might (1) harm or prejudice the integrity of the proceedings, or
(2) aggravate or exacerbate the dispute. Both may be seen as a particular
type of provisional measure [...] or simply as a facet of the tribunal’s
overall procedural powers and its responsibility for its own process.'®°

Measures for non-aggravation first appeared in the Convention for the
Establishment of a Central American Court of Justice,!®! Article XVIII of
which provided that ‘the court may at the solicitation of one of the parties,

fix the situation in which the contending parties must remain [...] to
the end that the difficulty shall not be aggravated’. Notwithstanding the
requirement on the face of the provision that it could only be exercised by
way of application, the Court in Honduras v El Salvador and Guatemala
quickly awarded measures sua sponte so as to cool a situation of armed
conflict between the parties.!*”

As argued in Chapter 2, the practice of the CACJ is sufficient to establish
a separate historical starting point for measures for non-aggravation when
compared to measures for the protection of rights pendente lite.!®° These
strands were then merged by the PCIJ through Article 41 ofits Statute. The
Court first indicated measures for non-escalation in Electricity Company
in terms that raised more questions than answers, relying as it did on:

[The] principle universally accepted by international tribunals [ ... ] to the
effect that the parties to a case must abstain from any measures capable of
exercising a prejudicial effect in regard to the execution of the decision to
be given and, in general, not allow any step of any kind to be taken which
might aggravate and extend the dispute.'**

This statement is significant for two reasons. In the first place, it asserts
that parties to international litigation are under general obligation to
avoid taking any action that may escalate a dispute. In the second, it
contains no clear indication of why the Court saw fit to award a measure
of this kind,'®° and no further indication of whether it conceived itself as
possessing a power to award interim relief separate from that required to
protect rights pendente lite.

B_ The International Court of Justice

1 A Separate Power?

The cue given by the PCIJ in Electricity Company was taken up by its
successor, with the IC] in Anglo-Iranian Oil ordering, inter alia, that

the parties ‘should each ensure that no action of any kind is taken

which might aggravate or extend the dispute submitted to the Court’'*°

Similarly worded injunctions followed in cases such as Fisheries
Jurisdiction,'®’ Nuclear Tests,'°8> and Tehran Hostages.'®? Despite its
regular invocation, however, the Court refrained from stating whether it
considered these measures to derive from a source of power independent
of those designed to protect rights subject to litigation,’? though in
Passage over Indian Territory, it rejected a Portuguese request to uphold
the right on the basis that a request had not been made through Article
Al, effectively confining the general principle of Electricity Company
within that aspect of the Court’s procedure.’?! However, in Burkina
Faso/Mali, a Chamber of the Court gave its opinion on the subject, noting
that:

[I]ndependently of the requests submitted by the Parties for the indi-
cation of provisional measures, the Court or, accordingly, the cham-
ber possesses by virtue of Article 41 of the Statute the power to indi-
cate provisional measures with a view to preventing the aggravation or
extension of the dispute whenever it considers that the circumstances so
require.!”

power could exist within the strict wording of Article 41.!”° Even then, the
Chamber’s statement in Burkina Faso/Mali contains a certain ambiguity
on its face, as one cannot be sure whether the power to which the Chamber
refers is the Court’s general capacity to award measures different to those
requested by the parties,'”” or the specific power to award measures for
non-aggravation’* — though the latter appears to be the more likely.'”

The ICJ, however, retreated from this position in the Pulp Mills case,
declaring that the ‘power of the Court to indicate provisional measures
can be exercised only if there is an urgent necessity to prevent irreparable
harm to such rights, before the Court has given its final decision’*”° This
decision to limit thus the applicability of Article 41 drewa lengthy response
from Judge Buergenthal, who argued not only that the Court possessed
two distinct powers under Article 41, but that in deliberately subsuming
one of these within the other it had ‘missed an opportunity [... ] to fully
address the legal implications of extrajudicial coercive measures..”"' Judge
Buergenthal further pointed out that Article 41 did not represent the outer
limit of the Court’s powers vis-d-vis provisional measures, but was rather
an expression of the ‘requisite powers vested in courts generally [... |
to ensure that the orderly adjudication of cases pending before it is not
ageravated or undermined by extrajudicial coercive measures resorted to
by one party.” In this connection, Judge Buergenthal noted:

196 See e.g. Thirlway, 1 Law and Practice, 946-53. Further: Aegean Sea, ICJ Reports 1976 p 3,
16 (President Jiménez de Aréchaga):

The Court’s specific power under Article 41 of the Statute is directed to the preservation
of rights sub-judice and does not consist in a police power over the maintenance of
international peace nor in a general competence to make recommendations relating
to the peaceful settlement of disputes.

198 Palchetti, ‘Provisional Measures to Prevent Aggravation’, 625-6.
199 See e.g. Lockerbie, ICJ Reports 1992 p 144, 158 (Judge Bedjaoui):

This is a case-law which, instead of focusing on a review of each prerequisite to the
indication of provisional measures, gives pride of place to a comprehensive analysis
of the ‘circumstances’ of the case, it being decided, on that basis, to indicate those
measures in the general terms of an exhortation to all the parties not to aggravate or
extend the dispute. The provisional measure thus taken, in the form of an exhortation,
does not in any way depend upon the indication of other, more specific provisional
measures.

212 PURPOSE OF PROVISIONAL MEASURES

The fact that the Court [...] has in all these prior cases also indicated
the first type of provisional measures, does not detract from the wording
of Article 41 of the Statute, which makes the decision whether or not
to indicate provisional measures dependent on the ‘circumstances’ that
may require it. These circumstances may involve an imminent threat of
irreparable prejudice to the rights in dispute. But, independently thereof,
no compelling reason has been advanced by the Court why they may
not also apply to situations in which one party to the case resorts to
extrajudicial coercive measures, unrelated to a subject matter in dispute,
that aggravate a dispute simply by seeking to undermine or interfere with
the rights of the other party in defending its case before the Court. In
such situations, the test would not be whether there is an imminent threat
of irreparable harm to the subject matter of the dispute, but whether the
challenged actions are having a serious adverse effect on the ability of the
party seeking the provisional measures to fully protect its rights in the
judicial proceedings.”

Given the wider history of provisional measures, Judge Buergenthal has
the better side of the argument. Measures for the protection of rights
pendente lite and measures for non-aggravation arise from two different
traditions of interim relief, a fact implicitly recognized by the PCIJ in Elec-
tricity Company in identifying a general rule of non-aggravation in inter-
national disputes.*"* For the Court now to claim — Burkina Faso/Mali and
its successor cases notwithstanding — that measures for non-aggravation
are merely ancillary to measures for the protection of rights is to diminish
its ability to ensure the integrity of proceedings on an interlocutory basis.
Nonetheless, in light of the Court’s dictum in Pulp Mills, this is (for now)
the status quo.*”

What then is the animus behind this apparent reversal? Palchetti iden-
tifies two reasons, both connected to the Court’s conclusion as to the
binding character of provisional measures in LaGrand.? Firstly, and
as seen in the ICJ’s increased emphasis on the plausibility test,”°” the
Court has taken as a general rule a more stringent approach to the
awarding of provisional measures so as to increase the legitimacy of any
orders so given. Secondly, the contextualization of provisional measures

MEASURES FOR THE NON-AGGRAVATION OF THE DISPUTE 213

post-LaGrand has led the Court to reemphasize that the primary pur-
pose of interim relief is the protection of rights pendente lite, with
measures for non-aggravation assuming a correspondingly diminished
role.

2 Preconditions for the Award of Measures for
Non-Aggravation

Following the 2007 Order of the ICJ in Pulp Mills, the preconditions for
an award of measures for non-aggravation are that a case for interim relief
to protect rights pendente lite must first be made out in its entirety, i.e.
the applicant must establish prima facie jurisdiction, identify a plausible
right sufficiently linked to the merits, and prove urgency and irreparable
harm with respect to that right. However, the award of measures for non-
ageravation does not follow from this a fortiori, and the Court has held in
cases such as Certain Criminal Proceedings that such are not appropriate,
appearing to utilize criteria independent of those for the protection of
rights.?"°

The ICJ has not enunciated a definitive test for the award of measures
for non-aggravation, though it is tolerably clear that much turns on the
particular circumstances of the case.””” Such measures are particularly apt
in cases involving the use of force, with the Chamber in Burkina Faso/Mali
noting that in such situations ‘there can be no doubt of the Chamber’s
power and duty to indicate, if need be, such provisional measures as may
conduce to the due administration of justice.?!? Similar concerns may
have driven the Court’s express reliance on its ‘independent’ power to
grant such measures in Cameroon v Nigeria and Armed Activities (DRC v
Uganda), as well as its decision not to in the rather different case of Certain
Criminal Proceedings. At the same time, however, there is no reason to
think that measures for non-aggravation are confined to cases with a
potential or realized risk of armed conflict, as the award of such measures
in the Nuclear Tests cases demonstrates. Certainly, this would accord with
the position taken in Electricity Company, where the PCI referred to the
need for parties avoid taking ‘any steps’ that might aggravate or extend a
dispute — a general formula that on its face extends beyond questions of
use of force.

214 PURPOSE OF PROVISIONAL MEASURES

3. Scope and Effect of Measures for Non-Aggravation:
The Border Area Case

Following on from the decision in Pulp Mills, it has become clear that the
ICJ now considers measures for non-aggravation to be supplementary to
measures for the protection of rights pendente lite. However, this position
is not necessarily out of step with the Court’s previous practice, where,
despite the assertions of independent power in Burkina Faso/Mali and
its fellows, measures for non-aggravation were never awarded absent
measures for the protection of rights. In terms of their overall effect, such
measures have historically performed a ‘catch-all’ function, serving as an
injunction to the parties to avoid making an already sub-optimal situation
worse.”!' This may include not only steps that may aggravate or extend
the dispute, but also steps that may generally cause prejudice to the rights
of the parties.”!* Further specific direction may also be given under the
rubric of non-aggravation.?!°

As such, the inclusion of measures for non-aggravation reflects the
realization by the Court that factual matrix before them is fluid, and
that the inclusion of very specific provisional measures for the protection
of rights may not adequately restrain a party from causing damage not
captured by the wording of those measures. A key example of this arose
in the Border Area dispute between Costa Rica and Nicaragua, in which
the utility of measures for non-aggravation was demonstrated over the
course of several Orders. By way of background, the Border Area case was
first filed by Costa Rica in 2010, and concerned the alleged ‘incursion into,

cafio) through said territory and that the canal, if completed, would cause
significant environmental damage through diversion of the watercourse
and deforestation of the occupied area. Nicaragua, for its part, asserted
that the territory in question was actually Nicaraguan, and its actions
were appropriate with its sovereign right to do with its territory as it saw
fit. Nicaragua further contested Costa Rica’s description of its activities
as the cutting of a canal, but submitted that it was merely dredging a
preexisting natural watercourse so as to return it to its prior state.

In its Order of 8 March 2011, the Court awarded provisional mea-
sures requiring that, inter alia, each party ‘refrain from sending to, or
maintaining in the disputed territory, including the cafio, any person-
nel, whether civilian, police or security’ and further that the parties
‘refrain from any action which might aggravate or extend the dispute
before the Court or make it more difficult to resolve’.?!? On 23 May
2013, Costa Rica filed a motion with the Court requesting modifica-
tion of the Order under Article 76 of the ICJ Rules. Costa Rica asserted
that whilst Nicaraguan military personnel may have withdrawn from the
contested area, Nicaragua continued to maintain an educational pro-
gramme whereby young Nicaraguan nationals were sent into the zone.
Nicaragua, in response, asserted that these nationals were private persons
belonging to the Guardabarranco Environmental Movement, undertak-
ing ‘environmental sustainability’ activities within the contested area, and
hence outside of its control.

The Court, in its Order of 16 July 2013, considered that the presence
of such a private — or at the very least ‘non-military’ — movement was not
contemplated when it made its earlier order for the protection of rights,
and thus there was no risk of breach of those measures. However, it did
not wish to indicate a total lack of concern with what was taking place
within the area, noting that:

[T]he presence of organized groups of Nicaraguan nationals in the dis-
puted area carries the risk of incidents which might aggravate the present
dispute. That situation is exacerbated by the limited size of the area and
the numbers of Nicaraguan nationals who are regularly present there. The
Court wishes to express its concerns in this regard.”!©

In this passage, the Court clearly implied that it considered Nicaragua
to be in breach of the non-aggravation measures contained in the earlier

Order. On this basis, the Court reaffirmed the measures indicated in that
Order, reminded the parties that such measures were binding and that a
breach of the Order could be effected by either an act or an omission, e.g.
by permitting the continued presence of private persons in the disputed
area.”!’ Finally, the Court noted that its findings were ‘without prejudice
as to any finding on the merits concerning the Parties’ compliance’ with
its Order of 8 March 2011, an indication that it was willing to take any
breach of provisional measures into account at a later date and a warning
to Nicaragua as to the potential consequences of further omissions.7!®

The Court’s use of measures of non-aggravation in this manner shows
the potential for such relief to restrain parties that may attempt to circum-
vent the plain wording of provisional measures. As it happens, Nicaragua’s
response was to continue to breach these measures, prompting the Costa
Rica to apply to the Court for an entirely new set of measures for the
protection of rights pendente lite, with the Court eventually exercising
its power to award measures well in excess of what Costa Rica actually
requested, whilst at the same time reaffirming its earlier orders, including
measures for non-aggravation.”!”

C Dispute Settlement Under UNCLOS

Like the ICJ, dispute settlement bodies under UNCLOS have endorsed the
power to award measures for non-aggravation despite the fact that such a
capacity does not appear expressly in the wording of UNCLOS Article 290.
This tendency appeared early on in the jurisprudence of ITLOS, with the
Tribunal recommending proprio motuin M/V Saiga (No 2) that the parties
‘should ensure that no action is taken by their respective authorities or
by vessels flying their flag which might aggravate or extend the dispute
submitted to the Tribunal’?”° In his declaration, Judge Vukas reflected
on the specific need for such measures and protested the lack of binding
wording in the majority’s formulation thereof:

[T]aking into account the nature of the case, the restraint of the parties
in respect of actions which might aggravate or extend the dispute is of
utmost importance. The tragic events which occurred on 28 October
1997 and afterwards resulted in human suffering and material damage.
Therefore, the Tribunal should have used the most effective measures in

order to convince the parties to abstain from any similar or other action
which might aggravate or extend the dispute pending the final decision
of the Tribunal. Under the applicable rules, such means are ‘prescribed
provisional measures’.

Judge Vukas’ sentiments were adopted in the Southern Bluefin Tuna case,
where both Australia and New Zealand requested ‘the parties ensure that
no action of any kind [be] taken which might aggravate, extend or render
more difficult of solution the dispute submitted”?! No comment on this
application was made by the majority beyond simply making a binding
order to this effect,”*” though Judge Eiriksson expressed reservations on
the basis that whilst the general proposition that parties should avoid
further aggravating a dispute was sound, the measure as drafted was ‘of
so general a nature that a party cannot be clear when contemplating any
given action whether or not it falls within its scope.””’ Such reasoning is,
with respect, specious — if the general proposition per Electricity Company
that parties should avoid escalating disputes is valid, then an order con-
verting this principle into an obligation binding on the parties is equally
unobjectionable.

Measures for the non-aggravation of the dispute were also considered
and awarded in Ghana/Cote d'Ivoire as a codicil to extensive measures
for the protection of rights pendente lite. As with the rest of the award,
the Special Chamber was relatively matter of fact about the measures in
question, simply stating that measures of non-aggravation ‘should not in
any way be construed as a waiver of |... ] or an admission of the claims
of the other party to the dispute’’”* before requiring the parties to ‘refrain
from any unilateral action that might lead to aggravating the dispute.?°

These cases represent the only occasions in which ITLOS — or any
other UNCLOS dispute settlement body — has ordered measures for non-
ageravation. Some further commentary on the power to order such mea-
sures emerges, however, in the extracurial writings of Judge Laing, who
links ITLOS practice on measures for non-aggravation to the preexisting
ICJ jurisprudence on the subject.”° If this is the case, then it may be that

the decision of the Court in Pulp Mills has resulted in a similar subor-
dination of measures for non-escalation to measures for the protection
of rights pendente lite for the purposes of UNCLOS Article 290, though
neither ITLOS nor any Annex VII tribunal has taken the opportunity to
comment on the subject.

D Inter-State Arbitration

The availability of measures of non-aggravation in wider inter-state arbi-
tration is presently unexplored, but given the identification of the concept
as a general principle of law in Electricity Company, it is likely that the
capacity to award such measures — whether at the instigation of the par-
ties or proprio motu — forms part of the broad suite of powers available
to international tribunals. In Kishenganga, however, an inquiry of this
kind was unnecessary, owing to the presence of an express power to order
such measures in Paragraph 28 of Annexure G.’”” However, the Court of
Arbitration did not consider this power in detail, instead electing to fix
its award in its power to avoid prejudice to the final award,”*° notwith-
standing Pakistan’s extensive submissions on the point.”

E_ Investor-State Arbitration

1 ICSID Arbitration

Unlike the drafters of Article 41 of the ICJ Statute and UNCLOS Arti-
cle 290, the framers of Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and the
corresponding ICSID Rules appear to have expressly considered non-
ageravation in preparing the provision, with Note A to Rule 39 of the
1968 iteration of the ICSID rules stating that Article 47 ‘is based on the
principle that once a dispute is submitted to arbitration the parties should
not take steps that might aggravate or extend their dispute or prejudice
execution of the award’.”°° Other investor-state arbitration tribunals have
modified this formula slightly on the basis of the travaux préparatoires to
the ICSID Convention, referring instead to measures intended ‘to pre-
serve the status quo as between the parties pending a final award by the
Tribunal’?!

MEASURES FOR THE NON-AGGRAVATION OF THE DISPUTE 219

The scope of this power was elaborated in the early case law.**” In
Amco v Indonesia, the Tribunal rejected the respondent’s request for pro-
visional measures preventing the claimant from speaking publicly about
the proceedings on foot. In so doing, the Tribunal stated:

All these remarks do by no means weaken the good and fair practical
rule, according to which both parties to a legal dispute should refrain,
in their own interest, to do any thing that could aggravate or extend the
same, thus rendering the situation possibly more difficult. However, in
the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal does not find any symptom of
an intention of the one or the other party to take steps that could have
such consequences; accordingly, the Tribunal does not deem it appro-
priate to issue a recommendation to the parties — which, moreover, is
not requested by Claimants — such recommendation not seeming to be
presently needed.?*’

Two points regarding the Tribunal’s attitude to measures for non-
ageravation arise from this passage. In the first place, the Tribunal did not
conceive of such measures as being dependent on first awarding measures
for the protection of rights pendente lite. In the second, as in the case of the
IC] in Certain Criminal Proceedings, the Tribunal hinted that there were
some additional factors that were to be taken into account in determining
whether measures for non-aggravation were appropriate, though these
were not the subject of expansion.7*4

Both points have been elaborated elsewhere. With respect to the first,
a key difference in some ICSID practice is for tribunals to fix on non-
ageravation as a general principle of international law as opposed to
merely a purpose for which provisional measures may be awarded. Con-
sequently, ICSID tribunals have awarded provisional measures for the
protection of a right pendente lite where the right in question is the par-
ties’ right to conduct proceedings without aggravation or escalation of
the underlying situation, injecting a measure of subjectivity into what
the ICJ and ITLOS would likely consider to be a purely objective inter-
est. This much was clearly enunciated in Plama v Bulgaria alongside the

232 ICSID Commentary, 793-5.

33 Amco v Indonesia (1983) 1 ICSID Reports 410, 412. The Tribunal in Holiday Inns v
Morocco was asked to consider measures for non-escalation by the claimant in that case,
though it did not address the problem directly: Pierre Lalive, ‘The First “World Bank
Arbitration (Holiday Inns v Morocco) — Some Legal Problems’ (1981) 51 BYIL 124, 134.

aforementioned relaxation of the link test.*°? Although this view may
not sit happily alongside modern understandings of that test,”*° if is pre-
sumed correct, it would be impossible for an ICSID tribunal to reach a
conclusion similar to that reached by the Court in Pulp Mills.’°’ Plama v
Bulgaria also sought to give substance to this species of measure, holding
that the obligation of non-aggravation refers to actions that would affect
resolution of the dispute. As such, non-aggravation may be seen asa right
for the preservation of the status quo, with measures to be awarded ‘when
a change in circumstances threatens the ability of the Arbitral Tribunal to
grant the relief which a party seeks and the capability of giving effect to
the relief.?°8

This position is not, however, unchallenged, and some arbitrators have
seen fit to follow the ICJ in redefining the relationship between the two
species of interim relief. This is precisely what occurred in CEMEX v
Venezuela, where a tribunal chaired by a former president of the ICJ,
Gilbert Guillaume, having rejected the claimant’s request for provisional
measures for the protection of rights sub judice, relied on Pulp Mills in
further denying measures for non-aggravation, noting:

Article 47 of the ICSID Convention does give ICSID Arbitral Tribunals
power to recommend measures directed at the preservation of the rights
of the parties. In exercising this power, ICSID Tribunals may recommend
measures in order to avoid the aggravation or extension of the dispute. But
those ‘non-aggravation’ measures are ancillary measures which cannot
be recommended in the absence of measures of a purely protective or
preservative kind.”*”

MEASURES FOR THE NON-AGGRAVATION OF THE DISPUTE 221

This view is not a popular one, but has been adopted by other ICSID
tribunals.”“? Although perhaps preferable to the status quo in the sense that
it upholds the conventional understanding of the link test, it is deficient
in the same manner as Pulp Mills in that it is insensitive to the unique
historical basis of measures for non-aggravation that permits them to be
awarded independently of other forms of interim relief.

Later cases have also elaborated on the preconditions for such mea-
sures. Ultimately, if the view in Plama v Bulgaria is held to be correct, and
non-aggravation takes the form of another right to be protected pendente
lite, then the appropriate preconditions are those of urgency and irrepara-
ble or significant harm.**! A significant case in this respect was Casado
v Chile, where, in response to a request by the claimant, the Tribunal
grounded its capacity to award such matters in the case law of the PCIJ
and ICJ, making express reference to Electricity Company, Anglo-Iranian
Oil and Armed Activities, as well as to Amco v Indonesia.*” Elaborating
further, the Tribunal stated that such measures were appropriate where ‘a
state of tension’ was in evidence as between the parties, and accordingly
requested that both parties ‘strictly comply with the general principle of
law [...] that no action of any kind is [to be] taken which might aggra-
vate or extend the dispute.” A further indication of when such measures
might be inappropriate was given in SGS v Pakistan, where the claimant’s
application for such measures was rejected on the basis that both par-
ties were cooperating, and neither of them had displayed a propensity
to aggravate the dispute.*“* Conversely, the initiation of bankruptcy pro-
ceedings against the claimant in Azurix v Argentina was sufficient to justify
the grant of the measure,** and in Perenco v Ecuador, the seizure of the
claimant’s assets prompted intervention on this basis.7“° In Biwater Gauff
v Tanzania, emphasis was placed on the fact that the aggravation in ques-
tion did not need to be concrete, and that assessing the required risk

‘necessarily involves probabilities, not certainties’.”*”

222 PURPOSE OF PROVISIONAL MEASURES

2 UNCITRAL Arbitration

The availability of measures for non-aggravation under the UNCITRAL
Rules is somewhat more uncertain, perhaps due to a dearth of practice.
It is interesting to note that no firm tradition of such measures appears
to have arisen before the Iran—US Claims Tribunal, perhaps owing to
the fact that disputes before that body ordinarily entailed no immedi-
ate risk of aggravation — the parties were usually at arm’s length and
the claimants’ preferred remedy was usually monetary compensation.
Where some immediate form of contact did persist, it was ordinarily in
the form of detained goods and other assets, in which case the preferred
form interim relief was an order for the preservation of those goods pur-
suant to the bare wording of Article 26(1) of the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules.
Targeted measures for the restraint of parallel proceedings were also of
greater utility than measures of non-aggravation.”

Recent practice under the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules has proved more
fruitful, particularly with respect to the various investor-state arbitrations
taking place under the auspices of the PCA or on an ad hoc basis. As
with some ICSID tribunals, such bodies sometimes eschew terminology
such as ‘aggravate or extend the dispute’ and prefer to speak in terms of
measures designed to maintain the status quo. In either case, the status
of the measure as a general prophylactic is the same. Thus, in Chevron
v Ecuador, the parties were ordered to ‘maintain, as far as possible the
status quo and not to exacerbate the procedural and substantive disputes
before the Tribunal”? Conversely, in Paushok v Mongolia, the Tribunal
ordered that the parties refrain ‘from any actions which would lead to
further injury and aggravation of the dispute between the parties’*”°
No indication is given in these decisions as to whether these tribunals
purport to follow the line of authority emanating from the ICJ, or the
approach adopted in Plama v Bulgaria and by other ICSID tribunals,
although the failure by the tribunal in Paushok v Mongolia to identify
non-aggravation as a particular right that could be subject to protection,

CONCLUSIONS 223

as well as its reliance on ICJ jurisprudence, may indicate a tendency
towards the former. Such conclusions are, however, strictly speculative,
and it should be noted that under the more relaxed variant of the link
test incorporated into Article 26(1),*°! either approach could be adopted
without doctrinal difficulties.

Measures for non-aggravation are undoubtedly available under Article
26(2)(a) of the 2010 UNCITRAL Rules, which permits relief generally to
‘maintain or restore the status quo pending resolution of the dispute’.

IV Conclusions

It is by now clear that the LaGrand judgment prompted in various inter-
national courts and tribunals a desire to increase the complexity of their
procedure regarding provisional measures. This has resulted in at least
two significant elaborations with respect to measures for the preserva-
tion of rights pendente lite. With respect to the first, all of the courts and
tribunals examined by this study now place additional emphasis (to the
extent it did not exist already) on the need for a link between the measures
requested and the rights subject to litigation. Depending on the body in
question, the concept ofa right subject to litigation and the strength of the
link so required may vary — but the general principal remains the same.

The second elaboration is more novel and — at least from the point of
view of certain ICJ cases — mildly heretical. It is now expected that the
provisional measures calculus will include an assessment of the strength
of the applicant’s case on the merits. Again, this may vary from tribunal
to tribunal — and it appears to be the permanent courts and tribunals
(i.e. the ICJ and ITLOS) that are more reluctant to apply a high level of
scrutiny at this stage, at least when compared to more ad hoc inter-state
and investor-state bodies that require that the applicant prove its case
to a prima facie standard. In this sense, it bears acknowledging that no
one approach is correct, and that the development of these requirements
presumably mirrors the institutional needs of each court or tribunal.

A third significant elaboration has concerned measures for the non-
ageravation of a dispute, and the insistence of the ICJ in Pulp Mills —
contrary to its earlier decisions in Burkina Faso/Mali and Cameroon v
Nigeria — that such measures may only be ordered following the award
of interim relief for the preservation of rights pendente lite. Such an
approach, it is suggested, is ahistorical, and fails to reflect that the two

251 Above §II.C.3(b).

224 PURPOSE OF PROVISIONAL MEASURES

forms of measure descend from different traditions of interim relief.
What is more, it may be seen to — as Judge Burgenthal hinted in Pulp
Mills — reduce measures for non-aggravation to a mere extrusion of (or
afterthought to) measures for the protection of rights. Nonetheless, the
procedure of international courts and tribunals is theirs to do with as they
wish — and if the subordination of measures for non-aggravation is seen
to be necessary to increase the legitimacy of binding interim relief, then so
be it. But it should not be seen to affect the inherent power of other courts
and tribunal to award measures for non-aggravation independently of
other measures for interim relief.
