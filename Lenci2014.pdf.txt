ACKNOWLEGMENTS

First of all, I wish to express my deepest gratitude to my mentor, Professor Luigi
Fumagalli, for his valuable guidance throughout these years of passion for International
Law. I also thank Professor Roberta Clerici for supervising the development of my
thesis with care and kindness.

I had the great chance to spend a semester at Sciences Po Law School in Paris, in the
quality of visiting Ph.D. Candidate during the second year of my doctorate; on that
occasion, I could improve substantially the results of my research and for this privilege I
am grateful in particular to Professor Emmanuel Gaillard, Professor Horatia Muir Watt,
Professor Diego Fernandez Arroyo, Professor Mikhail Xifaras and — last, but not least,
in this group — the Dean of the Law Faculty, Professor Christophe Jamin, for their
insightful comments on different parts of my thesis and for their encouragement.
Undoubtedly, I also feel indebted to all my friends and colleagues at the State
University of Milan and at Sciences Po for their support and contribution, with various
degrees, to my endeavours.

The Law libraries of these Universities, as well as the Peace Palace Library in The
Hague and the Studies and Documentation Centre “G. Schiavoni” at the Milan Chamber
of Arbitration, proved to be high-quality working venues, especially in_ their
complementarity: in this regard, I also wish to record my thanks to Ms. Bisacchi, Mr.
van Tol, Ms. Alihusain and Ms. Lovato for their kind assistance.

I thank my parents for their love and that subtle sense of confusion when I told them
that — after my graduate studies — I would study much more than I had ever done in my
life, instead of finding “a real job”: their feelings indirectly encouraged me to do my
best.

Finally, special thanks are due to a person, who over the years gave me tremendous
support; without her, I would not have achieved this result: therefore, the present thesis

is dedicated to you, Yasmine. Merci.

INTRODUCTION

“La durata del processo non deve andare a danno

dell’ attore che ha ragione” (Chiovenda).'

“International law is not a series of fragmented
specialist and self-contained bodies of law, each of
which functions in isolation from the others; it is a
single, unified system of law and each international
court can, and should, draw on the jurisprudence of
other international courts and tribunals, even though
it is not bound necessarily to come to the same

. 2
conclusions” (Greenwood).

This thesis deals with provisional measures in one of the fastest-growing areas of public
international law, namely international investment law and arbitration.

It constitutes a relatively recent topic and, since to the best of my knowledge no
monograph has ever been devoted thereto, my task in structuring this dissertation was at
the same time easy (I was completely free to choose) and difficult (there was no
extensive study to which I could refer). Moreover, the fact that this topic 1s a moving
target, as I will demonstrate, rendered my task more complicated and fascinating.
Therefore, I feel the need to inform the reader at the outset that this thesis constitutes a
very personal endeavour, since it aims at representing the current state of my topic as it
appeared to me throughout these three years.

After presenting the investment framework with a broad angle (Chapter one), the
analysis proceeds through the adoption of a differentiated approach: in Chapter two I

firstly draw on the history of the interpretation and application of provisional measures

' CHIOVENDA, Principii di Diritto processuale civile, terza edizione, Napoli, 1923, 802. The suggested
translation reads as follows:“The duration of the trial shall not cause damage to the claimant who is
right”. Of course, provisional measures are also significant in this sense to respondents.

in inter-State and State-private international adjudication (Section one) and, secondly,
address these measures from a comparative perspective inscribed in public international
law adjudication (Section two). Such a choice is by no means evident, due to the fact
that, to a certain extent, international investment arbitration bear a close resemblance to
international commercial arbitration, at least from a procedural viewpoint: in that
connection, the apparently most natural choice would have been that of comparing these
two mechanisms in the light of provisional measures. The international investment
regime is an area of law whose integration in the public-international-law or private-

international-law spheres is disputed for many reasons,° the main two of which are:

- first of all, it is a mixed dispute setthkement mechanism, involving a subject of
international law (the host State, 1.e. the State in which the investment takes place) and a
foreign private party (a natural or a legal person, whose international subjectivity is
controversial);”

- the dispute settlement mechanism adopted is international arbitration, which in and of
itself is a hybrid instrument, since it operates in both “pure” spheres (State-to-State

arbitration and international commercial arbitration).

Yet, in my opinion the choice of comparing the arbitral provisional power in
international investment arbitration and international commercial arbitration would have
been a wrong one, for two series of reasons, which can be briefly summarised as

follows:

> For an account of such debate within the Hague Academy of International Law, see ALVAREZ, The
Public International Law Regime Governing International Investment, Recueil des cours, Vol. No. 344,
2009, in pocketbook form (published in 2011), 93 f.

“The use of the term “participant” is preferred to that of “subject” or “object” of international law,
following the teaching of the then recently appointed as the first woman judge on the International Court
of Justice, HIGGINS, Problems and Process: International Law and How We Use It, Oxford, 1995, 49:
“There are no ‘subjects’ and ‘objects’, but only participants. Individuals are participants, along with
States, international organizations..., multinational corporations, and indeed private and non-
governmental groups”; also quoted by ALVAREZ, Are Corporations “Subjects” of International Law?,

Sovereignty, Oxford and Portland, 2011, 283.

Ph.D. Thesis — Federico Lenci

- The sovereign nature of one of the parties determines a fundamental difference
between the two frameworks, causing that group of disputes to be inscribed in public
international law adjudication, which merely share with international commercial
arbitration the dispute settlement tool;

- As a corollary, investment arbitral case law is perfectly able to influence (and to be
influenced by) consolidation, divergence and development of public international law,

constituting one of its sources under the terms of Art. 38 (1) lett. d) of the ICJ Statute.”

Consequently, I found it more appropriate to follow this approach, setting aside — save
for some exceptions, which will be justified — the analysis of arbitral case law in
international commercial matters.

Chapter three is devoted to the current state of provisional measures in international
investment arbitration. Section one addresses their specific features, namely legal force
and exclusive / concurrent jurisdiction to rule upon them. Thereafter, Section two
focuses on conditions, purposes and atypicalness of recourse thereto (in the effort to
describe the picture of the arbitral default rules as they emerge from case law), whereas
Section three sets some aspects of treatification and contractualisation of provisional
measures.

Chapter four discusses the rules applicable to the implementation of these measures,
considering voluntary compliance, non-compliance and its consequences, finally the
options available to the addressee in order to oppose their application.

My thesis concludes with some remarks on the role of consent, namely on the
possibility for the parties to amend such default rules before their potential dispute
occurs. Thus, they are able to tailor provisional measures to their needs, and particularly
to their bargaining power before the investment is carried out in the host State, so as to

increase legal security in that respect.

> Art. 38 ICJ Statute provides in relevant part that “1. The Court, whose function is to decide in
accordance with international law such disputes as are submitted to it, shall apply: [...] d. subject to the
provisions of Article 59, judicial decisions and the teachings of the most highly qualified publicists of the
various nations, as subsidiary means for the determination of rules of law”. The ICJ Statute is available at

STATE SOVEREIGNTY AND THE RULE OF LAW
IN THE INVESTMENT REGIME

A. General framework. — B. Relevance of provisional measures in international investment law. — C.

Towards a common procedural lexicon.

A. General framework

I. Terminological premises. — II. Overview. — III. Scope of the present study.

A.I. The purpose of this research is to address the most topical and, at the same time,
unclear issues raised by a controversial procedural instrument: the request for
provisional and protective measures in international — or ¢ransnational,' in order to
distinguish it from inter-State’ — investment arbitration. Actually, it is not controversial
in and of itself, since the great deal of uncertainty derives to some extent from the
available legal reactions to the failure of a party to abide by provisional measures taken
by international courts or tribunals in favour of the other party. The logical origin of
such difficulty consists in the question of the legal character of these measures, in
particular whether they are binding or not; in this sense, the use of the rather “neutral”
verb taken’ is not fortuitous, as the issue of the binding nature of provisional measures
also relates to the verbs adopted in the relevant articles of certain international legal
instruments.

As will be showed more extensively, said measures are recommended’ in the ICSID

Convention, indicated’ in the Statutes of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and of

its predecessor, the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ), prescribed’ in the
UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).’

Terminology, when misused, has yet another puzzling implication: expressions like
provisional measures and conservatory measures are often employed interchangeably,
while the latter indicates the purpose of said decisions (they serve the purpose of
safeguarding parties’ rights, a situation or evidence), and the former indicates the nature
of said decisions (i.e., they are reversible).* This distinction is not deprived of
importance, since there are measures which are not provisional, and still they fulfill
their conservatory character, such as — for instance — orders for the production of
documents,” which are meant to safeguard the parties’ rights to evidence and,

consequently, to a fair trial."°

That being said, some authors challenge such distinctions,
claiming that they lack precision."'

It is significant, in this sense, to underline the fact that in relevant provisions on
international arbitration the two adjectives are joined together in the expression
provisional and conservatory measures.'* Terms like interim, provisional, protective,

interlocutory, preliminary, precautionary, conservatory measures are often adopted

without distinction.’* The term which will be more frequently employed — failing a
reason to the contrary — in this thesis is provisional, simply because it is the one adopted
in the ICSID system, which is the principal frame of reference in international
investment arbitration; moreover, it seems more appropriate to stress the intrinsic nature
of these measures, rather than their variably declined finality (1.e., the element of

conservation).

A.II. Before addressing the core issue of this study (chapter 3) and the relationship
between the need to enforce provisional measures so as to create a reliable and investor-
friendly system — on the basis that such an environment is capable of promoting
economic development and prosperity of both home States and host States, as expressed
in the preamble to the ICSID Convention'* — and the necessity to respect host States’
sovereignty to regulate in the public interest, firstly it is deemed appropriate to focus on
the relevance of provisional measures in international investment arbitration, taking into
due account the asymmetries in this type of arbitration and the issues raised by its
fragmented approach to the matter. Indeed, it is suggested that the issue of the evolution

towards legal certainty as far as provisional measures are concerned is of paramount

importance in strengthening a friendly, effective and efficient environment in the
struggle with its major enemies, namely length and costs in the conduct of arbitral
proceedings.

Due relevance shall be paid to meta-legal and interdisciplinary subjects such as — among
others — the relationship between economic and legal globalization, since they are of
crucial importance in depicting the framework in which investments regulations operate
and modify their own scope and content. Such modifications have an impact on the role
attributed to public international law in the creation and development of investment
arbitration.

Its main characteristics will be addressed, in order to show the differences with
international commercial arbitration’? and the gnoseological reasons for its inclusion
into the public-international-law framework:'° indeed, it will be demonstrated that
international investment law shall not be considered as a legal regime through and
through detached from public international law. As a matter of fact, it is a se/fcontained
regime (only in part), but in the sense that it embodies its own rules of procedure;
moreover, mandatory provisions of the /ex loci arbitri — 1.e., those of the state in which
the seat of arbitration is placed — do not apply: therefore, it is a “non-national review

system’”.'’ This is so if the arbitration is ruled by the ICSID or NAFTA systems, while

commercial arbitration, the only really relevant treaty is the New York Convention wich ‘only’ deals with
the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards, while the other traditional instruments play no
major role today. On the other hand, for investment arbitration, treaties of public international law
provide the fundamental framework, particularly bilateral instruments as the more than 2,000 BITs, and
multilateral instruments as the ICSID Convention, the Energy Charter Treaty, and regional instruments
such as NAFTA and CAFTA”.

if the parties choose the ICC or LCIA rules, arbitrators and parties have to apply the
mandatory law of the place of arbitration."®

Secondly, the survey will deal with the relevant sources of international investment
arbitration and their connections with each other (chapter 2). The analysis will put under
scrutiny legal basis and features of provisional measures, in consideration of the
interrelationships between customary international law and other non-treaty sources of
law — arbitration rules, guidelines, model clauses and other soft-law documents — on the
one hand, treaty sources of law — bilateral, regional and sectoral investment treaties — on
the other hand. Straight thereafter, the focus will move to the matter of the origin of the
arbitral power to adjudicate in this field, the rule giving effect to the will of parties to
resort to arbitration in said legal order.

A brief account of the relevance of the most common provisional measures in
investment arbitration will be extensively dealt with in the appropriate chapter (3), with
a broad recourse to arbitral case law’’ as well as for the other most recurring provisional
measures sought by parties and (at times) granted by investor-State arbitral tribunals.
The survey of the relevant case law will also be of great help in the task of drawing the
main conditions, common characteristics and purposes of their requests.

It is possible to anticipate that the latter can be divided into four categories: - securing
discovery of evidence (in analogy with the judicial creation of the Anglo-Saxon
category of Anton Piller Orders’°). - preserving the parties’ rights;”' - preventing self-

help:”? - safeguarding the award’s enforcement.”

A.III. In a nutshell, this study aims at assessing the effects of the abovementioned
changes, and namely at examining whether and to what extent a new set of rules

governing provisional measures has indeed developed in the broader context of the

gradual emergence of general rules of procedure in international adjudication. This
process of “cross-fertilization”, in the words of Professor Chester Brown,”* occurs in
many respects, also due to the fact that international law makes no sharp distinction
between substantive law and procedural law.””

It is well known that the sources of international law are listed in art. 38, para. 1 of the

Statute of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), providing that

“The Court, whose function is to decide in accordance with international law such disputes as
are submitted to it, shall apply:

a. international conventions, whether general or particular, establishing rules expressly
recognized by the contesting states;

b. international custom, as evidence of a general practice accepted as law;

c. the general principles of law recognized by civilized nations;

d. subject to the provisions of Article 59, judicial decisions and the teachings of the most

highly qualified publicists of the various nations, as subsidiary means for the determination of

rules of law’”.”°

This provision is fundamental in the general analysis of the system, also considering the
exact wording “in accordance with international law” contained therein.7’ As a
consequence, if international investment arbitration — both ICSID and non-ICSID -— is
included within the public-international-law framework, then the sources listed in art.
38 apply to procedure and contribute to the shaping of its content. Indeed, looking at
this issue from another perspective, if international law and investment law pertain to
two different legal orders, their respective sources of law are independent and therefore
may deny the legal character of each other.** This explains the relevance, as a
preliminary step, of attempting to delimit the scope of investment law through the

analysis of the consequences deriving from the existence of a dispute with at least one

public party (a State or a State entity). This complex task — if successfully accomplished
— will also be of help in the endeavour of drawing a distinction between investment and
commercial disputes, which has significant implications in the present study.”’

Turning back to the issue of self-contained regime,*° this aspect is one of the most
significant consequences of the difference between the two mechanisms, since in the
latter domestic courts participate in many phases of the arbitral proceeding such as, for
the purpose of this study, when provisional measures have to be dealt with! Thus, it
refers to the independence of the arbitral process until the achievement of the res
judicata effect, in the sense that it prohibits review of the arbitral award by national
courts of member States.** However, the need for assistance of the latter is by no means
eliminated in the final phase, since for the recognition and enforcement of the award
rendered in its favour the winning party needs national courts’ power as provided for, in
the ICSID framework, by art. 54 of the ICSID Convention.** In addition, such an

assistance in terms of the procedure that has to be followed is not specified in the

(eds.), Liber amicorum Bernardo Cremades, Madrid, 952: “If it is looked upon purely from the point of
view of commercial arbitration it is difficult to explain its self-contained character, particularly since most
arbitration mechanisms allow for an ample participation by domestic courts in various stages of the
proceeding, ranging from the adoption of provisional measures to the challenge of the final award.
Conversely, if the ICSID system is looked upon purely from the perspective of traditional dispute
settlement under international law, it will become apparent that it does not fully share those
characteristics and features either”.

such designation.

Convention, and therefore courts are free to decide the means by which they will
comply, as State agents, with this treaty obligation.** Furthermore, it has to be briefly
outlined that, as provided for by art. 55 of the ICSID Convention, national law rules as
applied by courts are also relevant as far as the execution of the award is concerned,
since by agreeing to arbitration States have only waived their sovereign immunity from
jurisdiction, not execution.*’ It is one of the few remainders of the concept of due
deference to States as equal and superiorem non recognoscentes powers in interational

investment arbitration.

B. Relevance of Provisional Measures in International Investment Arbitration
I. The international economic environment. — II. Asymmetries in investment arbitration. — III. A key

issue: striking a balance between State sovereignty and protection of investor’s rights.

B.I. The mechanism of investment disputes settlement lies in the so-called mixed or
transnational arbitration, ° in which a private party — generally, the claimant — clashes
with a public one, i.e. the State — generally, the respondent host of the investment within
its borders.

Said condition raises issues of equality of arms in many respects, among which that of
provisional measures in investment arbitration. Just to make an example of structural
inequality, it is convenient to consider one of the most common measures requested by
respondent host States: security for costs (cautio iudicatum solvi in ancient Roman
times).

When respondent asks the arbitral tribunal to request the claimant to post a bond or
other security so as to cover expenses and legal fees of the arbitration alleging that its
case is groundless, if the tribunal issues such a decision and the claimant fails to comply
with it, the tribunal may consider it an admissibility issue, and thus suspend the
proceedings. As a matter of fact, by failing to comply with such a measure, the
Claimant shows an unwillingness to respect bona fide the ICSID tribunal’s jurisdiction:
this behaviour gives an evidence about its probable future non-compliance should an
adverse award be rendered against it.

Diplomatic espousal — originally exerced through gunboat diplomacy, before the
judicialisation/arbitralisation of such disputes — has always been a sovereign
prerogative: the investor had no rights to have its state protect its rights and interests. It
seems that recent developments have occurred in this field, and that they are worth of

research.>”

Through international arbitration, investors had the oppurtunity to control its dispute
with the host State — contrary to what happened with diplomatic espousal — without
being compelled to exhaust local remedies. From States’ perspective, the deal was
profitable, as it permitted to depoliticise the atmosphere entouring international
investments, thanks to the shift from State-to-State to investor-State disputes.**

By means of such a mechanism — even if it was limited to entering into legal treaty
(ICSID) commitment only to procedural issues under the auspices of a stable arbitral
institution, although not completely as will be addressed in this study on provisional
measures and namely on their “dark side” — its proponents, backers and policy-makers
aimed at giving certainty’ to investment outflows from developed capital-exporting
countries to developing (often newly-independent) ones.

As a matter of global macroeconomic policy, legal-economic certainty — or security —
through clear rules is a core element which has an enormous influence on the
investment climate.*” Conversely, it has been demonstrated that, when faced with high
uncertainty, firms reduce investment demand and delay their projects because they need
to understand the environment which they have to deal with.*! This hard reality is valid
for both national and international investment projects, and the same goes for the
microeconomic character of each scheme.

Uncertainty covers many aspects, and it is a multiplier of the effects of a financial crisis
which slows recovery by attacking the business cycle. It refers to a framework in which
the image is out of focus because information is lacking. In the majority of cases, the
adjective which has to be added to the noun “information” is “legal”. It is suggested that
the “dark side” of provisional measures is a part of the image which foreign investors

are struggling to bring into focus, and this aspect arguably contributes to slow down

economic growth and development in today’s ever more integrated international
markets.

In the last fifty years, many elements which put at risk a healthy economic development
have gradually been removed, in particular those which prevented foreign investors
from engaging into a fair competition with local firms while they were carrying out
their investment: for instance, many host States used to require from foreign
multinational enterprises that they share the property of their branches in those States
with local private investors or — in socialist countries — with the State itself, by means of
the creation of joint-ventures. From an economic point of view, greenfield investments
may have been much more profitable in many situations, not only for the foreign
investors but also for the host State and its taxpayers as well as any other individual
living therein, as it was demonstrated in early publications dating back to the 1960’s and
1970's.”

That state of facts has gradually been overcome in many respects, in particular after the
entry into force of the so-called “Trade-Related Investment Measures” (TRIMs) which
implemented national investment policies within the GATT/WTO framework,
providing that no member State shall apply a measure that is prohibited by the
provisions of GATT Article III (national treatment) or Article XI (quantitative
restrictions).

That evolution was driven by economic considerations, and in the same way even if it
appears difficult today to attribute the exact economic cost of uncertainties surrounding
— and, in part, historically incorporated into — provisional measures in international
arbitration, it cannot be excluded that such a task will be accomplished tomorrow.
Moreover, given the recent increase and consequent success of the ICSID arbitral
system, the opportunity to ask the tribunal to issue binding provisional orders so as to

avoid the negative effects of lengthier proceedings is and will be more and more urgent.

B.II. Focus on investment law and arbitration allows a clarification of the
interrelationship — or, rather, hierarchy — between norms of procedure in the field as
well as the procedural autonomy or delocalization of international arbitration.’ In fact,
it is suggested that not only treaty law — multilateral and bilateral investment treaties —
and case law, provided that the stare decisis principle does not apply in investment
arbitration,’ come into play in assessing the exact content of provisional measures in
the specific case at stake, but also in investor-State contracts. This consideration
notwithstanding, which reflects the principle of party autonomy in the choice of
procedural law applicable to the dispute, it must be noticed that parties rarely address
the issue of provisional measures specifically, since much more often they simply make
reference to institutional rules of procedure or resort to ad hoc arbitration allowing the
arbitral tribunal to determine the rules of procedure which it will follow.

At the same time, certain issues relating to provisional measures, such as that of their
nature — whether conventional, inherent or implied — and most importantly of their
binding force — whether merely recommendatory or binding — cause legal uncertainty,”°
which in turn severely affects investment flows in many respects.

Generally, before the foreign direct investment is made, the investor enjoys an
advantageous bargaining position while it is contracting with the host State, since the
latter needs the inflow of foreign capital, technology, jobs and income for its economic
development. However, after the investment has been made, if it proves to be
successful, that position is reversed. The investor counts on the contract — the former so-
called economic development agreement — it has entered into with the host State in
order to attain the estimated return on its investment, which normally takes a large
amount of time. During this period, if a change of policy towards FDIs occurs within
the host State, for instance due to a change of government, and the latter decides to
amend the provisions contained in the contract or even terminate it — withdrawing from
its original commitment — the investor lies in a critical position since it lacks those truly

effective means of reaction apart from that of resorting to arbitration: for the time being,

“ For a discussion see RENNER, Towards a Hierarchy of Norms in Transnational Law?, Journal of
International Arbitration, Vol. 26, No. 4, 2009, 554, in particular the interesting assumption of the
emergence of constitutional norms of international arbitration.

it finds itself deprived of its own investment. Therefore, political risk is generally taken
into consideration together with commercial risks linked to the sector where the
investment is about to be carried out. Consequently, there comes what has been called

47 Of the contractual balance between investor and host State: the

the “vicious circle
investor may use its advantageous initial bargaining position to attain particularly
lucrative conditions meant to take into consideration the political risk and permitting it
to reap the desired return on its investment in a shorter (thus, less risky) period of time.
The problem is that this is exactly what may be deemed to justify direct or creeping
expropriation from the host State’s perspective, since it is compelled to avoid being
“subjected” to a commitment which — if successful — grants excessive gains to the
investor. This vicious circle compromises, or at least significantly limits, economic
growth and development of the host State and the investment climate in general;
therefore it may be appropriate to be mitigate it through the rule of law, both substantive
and procedural (of course, including the rules on provisional measures).

Before addressing these measures, it is convenient to analyse the question whether
investor-state arbitral tribunals take part of the international system of dispute
settlement: can they be considered international jurisdictions? In order to elaborate an
appropriate and grounded reply, it is necessary to analyse the elements which
characterise such a jurisdiction as compared to national jurisdiction, and see if mixed
arbitrations comply with them. Professor Leben*® decides to draw these elements from
the International Court of Justice — which is undoubtedly an international jurisdiction —
and then to compare them with ICSID tribunals. The former was created on the basis of
a treaty, its procedure is consistent with international law, it applies international law, it
rules over legal disputes of an international character and its judgments are binding. In
relation to the application of international law, Mr. Broches — one of the negotiators of
the ICSID Convention — affirmed that ICSID tribunals should proceed through the
examination of the dispute having regard to applicable national rules and to

international law, as the latter lies in a hierarchically higher level.””

The other elements of ICSID tribunals will be further extensively dealt with, but it is
possible to anticipate that they are all met: the conclusion of the analysis will consist in
the assessment that they are true international jurisdictions.° This issue will be further
developed also in relation to non-ICSID arbitral tribunals. From these considerations it
is possible to derive significant implications, one of which for example is the
opportunity-necessity to analyse the legally (or not) binding force of provisional
measures in the light of the recent ICJ developments, starting from the LaGrand case,
according to the new interpretation which seems to be gradually emerging as a means to
resolve the traditional problems of effectiveness of any mechanism of international

adjudication. Such problems originate from the consensual basis of said jurisdictions.

B.III. After the conclusion of the abovementioned survey aimed at demonstrating that
investment dispute settlement mechanisms — including, with certain peculiarities, the
Iran-US claims tribunal created with the adoption of the Algiers agreements”’ — apply,
interpret and therefore influence the formation and evolution of international law
provisions and are inserted in the public-international-law regime,”” the focus moves to

the study of the way in which they are related with the other sources of international

State and that law will in the first instance be applied to the merits of the dispute. Then the result will be
tested against international law. That process will not involve the confirmation or denial of the validity of
the host State’s law, but may result in not applying it when that law, or action taken under that law,
violates international law. In that sense [...] international law is hierarchically superior to national law
under article 42”.

investment law, in particular but not exclusively treaty law. As a matter of fact, States —
and not just arbitrators of investor-State claims — retain the initiative for change as they
enter into investment treaties that contain more provisions in common (the so-called
Common Lexicon of international investment law, which extends also to procedural
rules governing provisional measures, through the evolution of BITs and arbitral case
law). Before addressing the controversial aspects of an incidental procedure within the
realm of investment dispute resolution, it is deemed necessary to firstly conduct a
survey on the legal panorama governing the phenomenon of the mutual relationship
between a State — or State entity — and a foreign private investor.

The historical context in which the ICSID Convention was negotiated, signed and
ratified explains the fact that many concessions had to be accorded to the block of the
newly independent capital-importing States in order to reach a broader consensus at
least to the relevant set of rules of procedure,’ in the effort of finding a balance
between sovereignty and investment protection.°’ Among said concessions are the
rather “soft” provisions of the mere recommendatory power of tribunals to issue
provisional measures as expressed in art. 47 of the ICSID Convention.

As it has been noticed,” tribunals have on many occasions ruled that they are under no
obligation to follow earlier decisions.°® Nonetheless, case law plays a major role in
evaluating and contributing to the development of international investment law.

In AES v. Argentina, the tribunal addressed the issue:

“Each tribunal remains sovereign and may retain, as it is confirmed by ICSID practice, a
different solution for resolving the same problem; but decisions on jurisdiction dealing with the

same or very similar issues may at least indicate some lines of reasoning of real interest; this

tribunal may consider them in order to compare its own position with those already adopted by

its predecessors and, if it shares the views already expressed by one or more of these tribunals

ona specific point of law, it is free to adopt the same solution”.””

Thus, arbitral case law plays a significant role as a source of international investment
law, since the interpretation of BITs and international investment agreements (I[As) by
investor-State arbitrators affects the legitimacy of this regime and the assessments of
increasingly fragmented or harmonious law.”®

In this attempt, due consideration will be given to the differences between ICSID and
non-ICSID arbitration, the peculiarities of international investment arbitration — a part
of public international law — as compared to international commercial arbitration and
the consequences in terms of rejected and accepted concurring jurisdiction” to issue
provisional measures: indeed, according to the former — which seems to be purported by
art. 26 of the ICSID Convention — State courts have no power to issue provisional
measures, since the ICSID tribunal is given jurisdictional exclusivity.’ In ICSID cases
where provisional measures are requested in order to enjoin parallel domestic litigation,
there is a struggle between the supremacy of international tribunals and the autonomy of
domestic courts. Indeed, provisional measures to enjoin domestic litigation challenge
States’ sovereignty to exercise their jurisdiction to conduct national proceedings within
their own territory.”'

A review of ICSID cases involving the request to enjoin parallel domestic proceedings

shows that the main rights invoked in support of provisional measures — according to

ICSID arbitration rule 39 — is the Claimant’s right to exclusivity of ICSID proceedings
and the right to non-aggravation of the ICSID dispute, both procedural rights. The first
is expressly set forth in art. 26 of the ICSID Convention. The second was firstly
established by the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) in Electricity
Company of Sofia v. Bulgaria, which held that

“The parties to a case must abstain from any measure capable of exercising a prejudicial effect

in regard to the execution of the decision to be given and, in general, not allow any step of any

kind to be taken which might aggravate or extend the dispute”.

The interrelationships between the investment treaty regime and non-treaty sources of
international law — among which 1s arbitral case law — has a huge impact on the real
world of States and investors. A great number of investors have potentially significant
stakes in knowing whether these treaties constitute a part of customary international
law. There are aspects of BITs that are /ex specialis: that is, intended to exclude the
applicability of any general rules to the contrary. And, as in a pyramid, there are
provisions on the law applicable to the possible disputes between investor and host state
which are included into an investor-state contract (when the investor has sufficient
bargaining power — it is not, of course, always the same — to compell the state to enter
into a contract in order to specify certain aspects of the investment and the protections
provided to it).°° In a nutshell, this part addresses the issue of the capability to create

tailor-made provisions on interim measures in investor-State contract.

C. Towards a common procedural lexicon
I. Concerns about the fragmentary structure of the matter at issue. — II. The role of arbitral

tribunals. — III. Some provisionally open problems.

C.I. From some assumptions above it is possible to derive one of the core issues
relating to the panorama of provisional measures, consisting in the capability of parties
to delimit their scope of application as provided for in art. 47 of the ICSID Convention

and in art. 39 ICSID Arbitration Rules. Such matters can be expressed as follows:

C. Considering the rather ambiguous content and force of said measures, since they
are textually recommended under art. 47 of the ICSID Convention, are States
entitled to increase its binding nature, simply by stating in the BIT that this is the
way they consider provisional measures to be possibly issued by arbitral
tribunals? Then, will the principle /ex specialis derogat legi generali be
applicable (lex generalis being the ICSID Convention, customary international
law and general principles of law recognized by art. 38, para. 1 c) of the ICJ

statute)?

D. In the abovementioned case, is it possible for parties to the investment contract
to agree on a different evaluation of the content of provisional measures, and
therefore soften their force by an express clause clarifying that parties interpret

them as mere recommendations?

E. Is the presence of an umbrella clause in the relevant BIT necessary in order to
permit parties to an investor-State contract to shape the scope of provisional

measures which can be issued should a dispute arise between them?

général, que la préférence doit étre donnée a la clause contractuelle, du fait qu’elle est la /ex specialis par
rapport a la /ex generalis du traité”.

48
Provisional Measures in International Investment Arbitration
Ph.D. Thesis — Federico Lenci

F. Are parties to a BIT entitled to exclude the power of the ICSID tribunal to issue
provisional measures? And what about parties to an investor-State contract? Is

the umbrella clause necessary in such cases?

G. Considering the de officio power of the tribunal to issue provisional measures,
are parties to a BIT entitled to exclude them also in this particular case? What
about parties to an investor-State contract? Is the wmbrella clause necessary in

such cases?

Parties to a BIT, and even more parties to an investor-State contract will be interested in
adopting legal rules providing them with taylor-made systems concerning provisional
measures, for different reasons which are justified by their different nature. Indeed, the
investor could, through this means, manage to obtain greater security to its investment;
the host state, assuming that it is a capital-importing state, could be able to send a clear
message to other potential investors about its investor-friendly attitude, and in general

about its commitment to free-market economy and free flow of capitals.

C.II. There is another aspect about freedom of parties to differ from ICSID Convention
provisions, which concerns the question of ICSID’s jurisdictional exclusivity under art.
26 of the Convention in issuing decisions on provisional measures. As a matter of fact,
art. 47 of the Convention provides that, except as the parties otherwise agree, a tribunal
may, if it considers that circumstances so require, recommend any provisional measures
which should be taken to preserve the respective rights of either party. Under art. 39 (5)
Arbitration Rules, the parties may, if they have so provided in their agreement, also
request a court or other authority to take provisional measures. If the parties wish thus
to provide for the possibility of seeking court-ordered provisional measures, they may
use Model clause 14, which reads as follows: “Without prejudice to the power of the
Arbitral tribunal to recommend provisional measures, either party hereto may request
any judicial or other authority to order any provisional or conservatory measure,
including attachment, prior to the institution of the arbitration proceeding, for the
preservation of its rights and interests”. Unlike the trade regime, there is no single,

overarching multilateral treaty on investment, nor is there an accepted “model” for an

49

investment protection, but still there is an emerging body of soft law rules, or rather
auxiliary provisions which may be of help to parties when negotiating their positions.
The issue of the enforcement of provisional measures is logically connected to their
legal authority: if we are dealing with mere recommendations, any reflection on their
enforceability is inevitably groundless.

In his Commentary,” Professor Schreuer notes that the travaux préparatoires of the
ICSID Convention reveal that the negotiating States were reluctant to grant tribunals the
power to issue binding provisional measures.°° In particular, such a force was opposed
by the newly-independent States, which saw it as a possible means to impose a new
form of economic colonization, or at least of gunboat arbitration” as will be further
discussed. Indeed, art. 47 and art. 39 Arbitration Rules stipulate that tribunals may
recommend provisional measures. Nevertheless, as Professor Schreuer explains,”’ this
does not detract from the legal relevance of such measures. The general obligation
devolving on parties to behave bona fide pending international adjudication and not to
frustrate the object of arbitral proceedings generally gives rise to the obligation to abide
by any measures, issued in the course of such proceedings, which may be necessary for
the effectiveness of the arbitral dispute settlement mechanism on the whole.

The legal authority of ICSID tribunals to issue binding rulings on provisional measures
is undisputed, beyond any doubt. The most relevant arbitral precedent in this sense is
Maffezini v. Spain: in Procedural Order no. 2, the tribunal noted that the difference
between the term recommend used in arbitration rule 39 and the term order used
elsewhere in the rules to indicate a tribunal’s power to direct a party to undertake a

certain action, is “more apparent than real”. For the tribunal, its authority to rule on

provisional measures was “no less binding than that of a final award” and the word
recommend was deemed to be of equivalent value to the word order.”

The tribunal’s reasoning in Maffezini was relied upon by the tribunal in Victor Pey
Casado v. Chile in order to support the conclusion that the question of the binding
nature of provisional measures is no longer controversial. In its decision on preliminary
measures, the Victor Pey tribunal also drew an analogy with the case law of the
International Court of Justice on the interpretation of art. 41 of its statute (in particular,
the La Grand case) and with the precedents offered by the Iran-US Claims tribunal.

In Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania, the tribunal both recommended and ordered provisional
measures in response to Biwater’s various applications. Although the tribunal did not
explain the reasons for the different wording used in its Procedural Order, it appears that
it recommended certain measures when it did not wish to indicate any specific finding
or final determination, but simply intended to recognize the existence of a need to
preserve evidence or chose to proceed in that manner for reasons of case management.”
In contrast, the tribunal ordered the production of a narrow category of documents
given their relevance and materiality for the case. By the way, such orders in certain
cases have been issued by ICSID tribunals under art. 43 of the Convention, not art. 47:
this fact will be more broadly dealt with, since it concerns some important aspects of the
definition and nature of interim measures (1.e., whether they are all provisional or not).
In any event, it appears that the Biwater tribunal intended to assign different degrees of
legal force to the measures granted, whereby certain measures which were ordered

seemed to be more binding than those that were simply recommended.

C.I. After introducing the relevant elements of the consideration on the possibility to
enforce provisional measures, this survey will focus on the means through which said
enforcement could be viable. Home States may resort to countermeasures, or to
diplomatic protection, which they renounced by concluding the ICSID Convention (art.
27). States may act in diplomatic protection if the other party fails to comply with its

obligation to respect judicial decisions, and thus to pay the award rendered against it.

Provisional Measures in International Investment Arbitration
Ph.D. Thesis — Federico Lenci

The same could go for the failure to respect provisional measures, but it is an ambitious
hypothesis which shall be deeply verified: it could be constitute a possibility for future
developments, because neither the current status of treaty law (ICSID, BITs, I[As) nor
arbitral case law give any indication in this sense.

Secondly, sanctions will be addressed, and other potential perspectives towards the
confirmation of the binding nature — and effectiveness — of provisional measures, thanks
to the adoption of the 2012 US Model BIT.

This area of international law is living a period of great expansion: the ICSID
mechanism of investment dispute settlement has proved to be affordable. The number of
applications filed with the Centre has significantly increased, and thus — proportionally
— the duration of proceedings. This aspect, combined with greater conflictuality between
capital-importing and capital-exporting States and the impact on their respective

investors show the importance of clear rules concerning provisional measures.

THE TWO-FOLD LEGAL PERSPECTIVE
CONCERNING PROVISIONAL MEASURES
IN THE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL ORDER

historical and comparative perspective.

I. Cross-fertilization. — Il. Consolidation of arbitral jurisprudence. — II. The doctrine of precedent in

international investment arbitration as soft stare decisis principle.

A.I. First of all, it is deemed appropriate to explain the exact content of the title of this
chapter. Provisional measures will be addressed hereinbelow through what I termed a
“differentiated approach”. Indeed, it is submitted that the exercise of attempting to grasp
all the elements of such a fascinating procedural instrument is best served through the

adoption of two perspectives, gua re its two-fold nature:

1) the historical approach. To put it in an image, the straight line;

2) the comparative approach. To put it in an image, the circle.’

It is common knowledge that the institution of provisional measures does not constitute
a novel phenomenon within the mechanisms of international dispute settlement. As a
matter of fact, this type of incidental proceeding derives its origin from the common —
though differentiated — practice in national legal orders. To analyse the evolution from
national to international fora in this respect and distinguish every characteristic and

consequent peculiarities consist of fascinating tasks which will contribute to a better

understanding of the real nature of these measures in international investment
arbitration.

It is of utmost relevance to note that the domestic / international divide between legal
orders may play a role as a descriptive key; however, such an exercise of drawing
analogies” thereupon shall be conducted with great caution in this field,’ as the
“compulsory / voluntary” jurisdiction binomial can impair our capability to understand
the peculiar features of the institution. Nonetheless, reference to said binomial will be
made whenever it will be deemed appropriate for descriptive purposes and bearing in
mind such a caveat.

Indication has been made to the theoretical legal framework of the present inquiry, the
one which most influences its development throughout these pages, namely that
international investment arbitration is inscribed in public international law,” with all the
consequences deriving therefrom which will be discussed in detail below. However, this
does not mean that a rigid separation between public international law and private
international law shall be maintained or — even worse — erected.’ On the contrary, it is
submitted, and will be later demonstrated in detail, that there exists an interesting
dialogue between these two areas. Nonetheless, distinguishing the origins of each aspect
thereof will help to grasp the true nature of provisional measures in the international
legal order.

To put it briefly through an image, such an endeavour is analogous to that of a narrator
describing the characteristics of each of two speakers who discuss: the content of their
dialogue will be better understood by the reader throughout said description.

Short of addressing the topic of fragmentation / proliferation® of public international

law,’ which is outside the purpose of the present study, it is nonetheless deemed

appropriate to insist on the refusal to consider this branch as a self-contained régime. As
a matter of fact, it is sufficient to review the plethora of recent as well as older ICSID
cases — easily available due to a policy more favourable to overcome confidentiality — to
ascertain the issues arising from the mixed-disputes system: since they involve a public
party (the Sovereign or one of its emanations — public companies), reference is
constantly made — by the parties and arbitral tribunals — to public international law both
as body of rules applicable to the dispute and as general framework in order to construe
the case and solve it. State immunity, sovereignty and responsibility are examples
thereof.

Furthermore, arbitral tribunals constantly — and to an increasing pace — refer to the
construction of public international law as interpreted and applied by the International
court of justice. Such a judicial borrowing, so far unilateral,® contributes to giving
evidence — if need be — that the two “systems” constitute a single legal order, wherein
the investment framework differs ratione materiae, on the adjudication mechanism and
so forth, but still within the same set of applicable rules and — to a certain extent as will
be seen — procedural settings. Such cross-fertilizations (one of which has so far
remained hidden) represent vital energy for the overall international arena.”

So far, analogies and differences in the procedure of international adjudication organs
have not been sufficiently explored. Indeed, they have attracted little attention, since a
significant majority of academics tend to specialise in a particular area of law and
analyse-monitor the single court — or group of arbitral panels — which deals with that
particular area. The purpose of this study is exactly to counter such a tendency and

show the existing interrelationships between courts and their jurisprudences.

With reference to the structure of the chapter, section B is divided into two parts: after
the approach to the matter of the institution of provisional measures in the international
framework from an historical perspective in para. I, in para. II a comparative analysis of
the sources concerning the institution will follow, grounded on the theoretical basis that
international investment law is inscribed in public international law: as a consequence,
the idea is that of attempting to bridge the divide between disciplines of the same family
and in this respect the previous presentation of the history of the institution will be
helpful.

Treaties, arbitration rules, guidelines and general principles of law will be the dramatis
personae which will appear on stage, accompanied by the constant presence of arbitral
jurisprudence on the conditions, purposes and atypicalness of provisional measures in
the following chapter. Indeed, all chapters are interdependent with each other.

For instance, let us refer to the relationship between chapter 2 and chapter 3.

The former consists of a two-fold analysis of this incidental proceeding, wherein the
differentiated approach expressed through the historical and comparative inquiry is
presented in sequence.

Chapter 3 aims at presenting the current status of provisional measures in international
investment arbitration (1.e., the descriptive phase, Sein; in an image, the point) and at
discussing their foundation in order to construe the avenues for their legitimate
development (i.e., the normative phase, Sol/en; in an image, the straight line going
forward). Consequently, chapter 3 constitutes a step forward in relation to chapter 2 in
both respects: indeed, there is a ratione temporis shift to the current status of
provisional measures and at the same time a ratione materiae shift to investment
arbitration.

To put in simplified images the two-fold differentiated approach of chapter 2, the
historical evolution of the institution is represented by a straight line, whereas the
comparative narrative is represented by a circle.'? As a consequence, figuratively, the
straight line and the circle of chapter 2 represent the vehicle through which the
legitimacy of focusing on a point — rather, a series of points — and indicating the straight

line going forward in chapter 3 is construed.

'° The scientific relevance of comparative perspectives in international law can not be explained in all its
facets: it is herewith simply submitted that it is vital to construe this field by pursuing this path.

A.II. As far as consolidation of arbitral precedents 1s concerned, it has to be noted that,
starting from the beginning of the new millennium, we are witnessing a true “baby-

boom”!!

of investment treaty arbitration. Said phenomenon is due to many factors,
among which — as a temporal sequence — the following general steps: fall of the
communist ideology and, consequently, generalised endorsement of the Washington
consensus,’ worldwide proliferation of a web of BITs, generally providing for
international arbitration under the auspices of ICSID or ad hoc arbitration under the
UNCITRAL rules as main dispute settlement mechanisms in addition to recourse to
local courts; in such a investment-friendly climate — or, at least, apparently so — the flow
of outward investments increases significantly,'° bearing with it the related increased
ratio of disputes, for the main reason that these systems proved to be effective and
relatively less costly in terms of legal certainty, time and expenses.

As a consequence, there has been a consolidation of arbitral jurisprudence on the most

significant topics of the investment framework, including issues concerning provisional

measures.

A.III. Arbitrators in the investment framework constantly refer to previous cases either
in support of their interpretation and application of the law, or in order to oppose their
assessments, or — thirdly — to harmonise and propose new paths: in any of these three
approaches, arbitrators contribute to the development of international investment
arbitration through consolidation of the adjudication process. As a matter of fact, they

pay due attention to previous cases even if they do not deem to be compelled to do so.'*

One may also bear in mind the fact that arbitrators are inclined to refer to previous cases
due to the submissions of the parties, who try to substantiate their cases through an
abundant — sometimes excessive’ — invocation of arbitral awards. Short of generalising
too much on that, it is argued that they feel their role as being not limited to the arbitral
settlement of the dispute’® before them: the majority of them understand that their role
is also that of setting the general framework, a task which is beneficial not only to the
parties of that specific dispute but to the whole international investment community
(investors and home/host States).'’ Such an element sets a significant divide between
international investment arbitration on one side, international commercial arbitration on
the other: indeed, it has been demonstrated that, as far as the latter 1s concerned,
arbitrators refer significantly less often to previous cases.'* This is probably due, it is
submitted herewith, to the different approach to the theme of confidentiality’? and —
more importantly — because international commercial disputes are more fact-specific

towards the real settlement of the dispute, i.e. the moment in which either the claimant manages to
enforce the award declaring in its favour, or the award denying compensation or — less frequently —
restitutio in integrum to it acquires its res iudicata state and the respondent manages to cover its expenses
and legal fees.

while investment disputes resemble each other to a greater extent at least in their

backgrounds.*” Moreover, in the words of Prof. Walde:

“Commercial arbitration is a suitable mechanism for resolving the disputes of equal parties on
equal footing and without need for the purpose of taking into account the position of the weaker
party; nor is there any policy purpose underlying commercial arbitration — such as to protect and
promote investment, enhance transparency and the “rule of law”, create employment or enhance
trade opportunities. In commercial arbitration, rules including the caveat emptor and due
diligence principle are deeply ingrained in the culture, approaches and principles applied
consciously or subconsciously by the tribunals. By contrast, international investment law is
aimed at promoting foreign investment by providing effective protection to foreign investors

exposed to the political and regulatory risk of a foreign country in a situation of relative

21
weakness’.

Besides, one may argue that the growing rejection of confidentiality and the parallel
increase of amicus curiae briefs — involving significant actors within the global
societies and national realities — is nothing but a significant evolution towards the
insertion of investment treaty arbitration within the public sphere, whereas earlier
studies and sensitivities inscribed the latter in the private one.””

International investment law is evolving and consolidating at a significant rate. In this
process, one may not neglect the role of international investment tribunals in setting the
general framework in this field, so peculiar as compared with international commercial
arbitration as discussed above, which seems to be more focused on the specific cases at
stake.

There is an ongoing debate on the doctrine of precedent among arbitral tribunals.”°

analysis of the theme and summarised his views in his famous separate opinion in the

Thunderbird case:

“In international and international economic law — to which investment arbitration properly
belongs — there may not be a formal “stare decisis” rule as in common law countries, but
precedent plays an important role. Tribunals and courts may disagree and are at full liberty to
deviate from specific awards, but it is hard to maintain that they can and should not respect
well-established jurisprudence. WTO, ICJ and in particular investment treaty jurisprudence
shows the importance to tribunals of not “confronting” established case law by divergent
opinion — except if it is possible to clearly distinguish and justify in-depth such divergence. The
role of precedent has been recognised de facto in the reasoning style of tribunals, but can also be
formally inferred from Art. 1131 (1) of the NAFTA — which calls for application of the
“applicable rules of international law”; these include, according to Art. 38 of the statute of the
International Court of Justice: “International custom, as evidence of general practice accepted as

law” and “judicial decisions” as “subsidiary means for the determination of rules of law”.

The leading view is that they are not bound to follow earlier precedents, which may be
called hard stare decisis principle;*? however, if the latter is persuasive, arbitral
tribunals may follow them or state the reasons why they decide to decline to follow
them. I call the latter soft stare decisis principle. A significant list of cases may be
quoted in this respect. One of the clearest examples of such an approach is expressed in
the Saipem v. Bangladesh case, conducted under the auspices of ICSID, whereby the
arbitral tribunal firmly stated that

“The Tribunal considers that it is not bound by previous decisions. At the same time, it is of the
opinion that it must pay due consideration to earlier decisions of international tribunals. It
believes that, subject to compelling contrary grounds, it has a duty to adopt solutions established
in a series of consistent cases. It also believes that, subject to the specifics of a given treaty and

of the circumstances of the actual case, it has a duty to seek to contribute to the harmonious

development of investment law and thereby to meet the legitimate expectations of the

community of States and investors towards certainty of the rule of law”.?°

Then, the question arises as follows: what is the proper role of investment arbitrators?
Sure enough, the arbitral tribunal could not have expressed more clearly its view of the
duty of arbitrators in the investment régime: these lines, whose main contentions were
followed by a relevant number of arbitral tribunals, give a clear indication of the idea in
this respect. First of all, it declines to uphold a hard stare decisis principle in
international investment arbitration like in the common-law tradition; however, it firmly
asserts that a relationship with previous decisions is — and indeed has to be — undeniable
(“it must pay due consideration to earlier decisions of international tribunals” [italics
added]).

Immediately thereafter, such a relationship is explained: if the elements of the case at
issue do not indicate the necessity to the contrary, the arbitral tribunal has a duty to
follow the decisions on points of law made in earlier cases. Such a soft stare decisis
principle consists in an inversion of the burden of proof, in the sense that — to show it
through an image — the playing field is not levelled, i.e. there exists a presumption iuris
tantum that from certain elements of the case certain findings of law shall derive, and it
is up to the opposing party to reverse such a condition, no matter if it is claimant or
respondent in the case.””

Finally, the arbitral tribunal explains the reasons behind such an approach, at the same
time answering the question about the proper role of arbitrators: their duty is “to seek to
contribute to the harmonious development of investment law”, an indication of the

relevance of arbitral precedents in the sources thereof.

jurisdiction and recommendations of provisional measures dated 21 March 2007, para. 67 [footnotes
omitted]. The arbitral tribunal was composed of Prof. Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, Prof. Christoph
Schreuer and Sir Philip Otton. It is to be noted that the President of such a high-level panel of arbitrators
was Prof. Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, who undoubtedly exerted a significant influence on this aspect of
the decision: one may infer that from the doctrinal positions of each of these eminent arbitrators and on
the reference made in the abovementioned paragraph to a lecture delivered by the Swiss scholar and
referred to supra footnote 18.

°7 One may not be unaware that such legal terms are borrowed from the different area of fact-finding
process, i.e. the way in which the nexus of causality from a known fact to another which is unknown is
established. Indeed, it is submitted that the same terms can be helpful in explaining the reasoning of the
arbitral tribunal.

61
Provisional Measures in International Investment Arbitration
Ph.D. Thesis — Federico Lenci

Alternatively, or rather additionally, such a burden would lie with the arbitral tribunal:
this view was expressed by Professor W4lde in another passage of his famous

concurring opinion in the Thunderbird case:

“130. In consequence, it appears to me that at the very least that, if a tribunal wishes in a
significant question, to adopt a novel philosophy that diverges from well established principles
is under an obligation to provide the parties with an opportunity of a full debate — such as
calling for a “separate argument on the allocation of fees and expenses after rendering a
decision on the merits” — and to provide extensive reasoning which shows that the tribunal is
both familiar with established jurisprudence and is prepared to justify its departure from such
jurisprudence with in-depth reasoning”.

In a nutshell, if an investment tribunal deems it appropriate — or, as one may insidiously

suggest, “necessary”, because otherwise the previous tendency shall be maintained — to

depart from an established jurisprudence, it is under three obligations,’ namely:

1) to employ a reinforced version of the contradictoire principle;
2) more significantly, that sententias novit curia; and

3) to prove that such a departure 1s justified.

A leading scholar and practitioner, Prof. Fernandez Arroyo, sheds light on the
distinction above mentioned between binding and persuasive precedents through
reference to — respectively — “jurisprudencia de iure” and “jurisprudencia de facto”.*°
What follows notwithstanding, in terms of issues of legitimacy of the overall process,
since such a position is correct and contributes to legal certainty in the field (without

preventing other paths from being preferred if appropriate in the view of the law-

dealing with an adjudicating body.

making actors), this inquiry will significantly be construed on the arbitral jurisprudence
concerning provisional measures in international investment arbitration.

Nonetheless, one may not neglect — as a general aspect — that certain States appear as
respondents before arbitral tribunals much more frequently than others (for example,
Argentina, Bangladesh and Pakistan on one side — the repeat players -, Germany and the
United Kingdom on the other).*' Therefore, if arbitral tribunals are gradually acquiring
the role of shaping the international investment framework, the States which appear
very often before them have many more opportunities to contribute in the shaping of
such a framework than others. As a consequence, it is submitted that the latter will be
compelled to deal with an undue burden of proof incumbent upon them. In other words,
these States will — and do — face the difficulty arising from the need to revert certain
jurisprudences which have consolidated through precedents to which they did not take
part, either because they did not obstruct foreign direct investments or because they
were mostly capital-exporting States.

By way of example, one may mention the case law on the state of necessity, wherein
Argentina — certainly unwilling to do so — contributed significantly. In such a scenario
of arbitralisation of international investment law, there may be an evolving process
likely to weaken the overall legitimacy of arbitral decisions. Such an assumption might
seem to be excessive; indeed, it serves the purpose of provoking examinations and
discussions which are not sufficient to satisfy the appetite of those who question the
legitimacy of the investment architecture provided in these last fifty years and, more
importantly, of those who are convinced that only through questioning the existent
framework can institutions develop and prosper.

Is then the need to multilteralise substantial provisions*’ through a multilateral
convention more stringent?*’ One of the last attempts in this sense was the MAI

(Multilateral Agreement on Investments) project, which — curiously indeed — read in the

*! Or Brasil, which decided not to participate to the ICSID system and relies consistently — and with an
apparent success — on its national legislation (lei dos investimentos).

italian language and then translated into english means “never”, perhaps suggesting its
feasibility. To analyse further these substantive-law aspects of the international
investment framework is outside the purpose of the present research; however, the aim
of these lines is that of presenting the problem of the twofold impact of arbitral
jurisprudence on both substantive and procedural provisions in this respect, since it

influences the consolidation of certain options in both sides of the handling of disputes.

analysis of the sources concerning provisional measures in contemporary public international law.

After the introductory remarks contained in section A, it has to be added — in order to
present the methodological basis from which the structure of this central chapter derives
— that such an inquiry will be conducted through two thematic lenses: firstly, the
evolution of the institution in international litigation (para. I) and, secondly, a
comparative assessment of the current state of the interpretation and application of
provisional measures within the public-international-law framework (para. II).**

These two perspectives serve the purpose of constituting premises for the assessment of
both the procedural and substantive elements which compose this peculiar incidental

proceeding.

The study of the origins of an institution is in the majority of cases — if not all — a
fundamental exercise in view of the discussion of the current features thereof. In this
respect, the research on the early developments of provisional measures is not an
exception. Many fascinating elements can be drawn therefrom and shed light to new

issues. One example may provisionally suffice to prove this point.

Provisional Measures in International Investment Arbitration
Ph.D. Thesis — Federico Lenci

It is well known that interim® measures consist in a tool mainly at the disposal of the
parties in order to — grosso modo, of course not exclusively — safeguard their rights*°
pendente lite and therefore try to annul, or at least reduce, one of its main defects, 1.e.
the passing of time and the risks connected thereto. Thus, the dispute is crystallized
before the adjudicating body. At this stage, one may call it “abstract framework’, since
the latter does not necessarily coincide with the final disposition of the legal position of
each party. As a consequence, provisional measures are directed to address the gap
between such an intrinsic abstract framework and the real one, thus impacting on the
capability of the opposing party of manoeuvering in a prejudicial fashion to the
applicant.

In this respect, the wise and still actual words of the German / Polish mixed arbitral

tribunal of 1924 are illuminating:

“Par les mesures conservatoires les Tribunaux cherchent a remédier aux lenteurs de la justice,

de maniére qu’autant que possible l’issue du proces soit la méme que s’il pouvait se terminer en

: 37
un jour”.

It can be noted that in this passage the use of the word conservatoire, underlining the
purpose of the measure, substitutes that of provisoire, pointing instead to its nature.°®
Incidentally again, it is possible to anticipate that such a dichotomy still exists in French
Law.

Turning back to our example, the main purpose of these measures consists in the
protection of a right or other subjective legal position of the parties. Quite surprisingly,
historical traces of the purpose of provisional measures in earlier periods show that their

origin is due to the intention of judges to accomplish appropriately their main function,

“interest of a legal nature”, stressing the fact that a definitive evidence of their existence has not yet been
given, since the arbitral tribunal has not pronounced itself thereupon.

namely maintain social peace through the rendering of a just decision.*’ Such a
theoretical line can be found in some passages of the Procés-verbaux of the Drafting
committee charged with the task to present a text to the Council of the League of
Nations for the adoption of the Statute of the Permanent court of international justice,
whereby the committee sketched a right of initiative for the Court if it considered that
the circumstances so required.”

Another historical reason consists in the will of the adjudicating power to protect its
own authority and prestige: provisional measures prevented the judgment to be issued
from being moot and nugatory, lacking any chance of being enforced.

These two reasons constituted the premise of a de officio”’ power to guarantee interim

protection, which still exists in our times in public international adjudication.”

B.Li. Before outlining the main steps through which they developed until the creation of
the International court of justice,”’ a clarification is necessary on the initial term of the
research. Indeed, it is well known that international arbitration has a millenary history as
an effective dispute settlement mechanism.” For our purposes, however, it is sufficient
to start our inquiry at the beginning of the modern era of international arbitration,
inaugurated by the early experience of the /nstitut de droit international:” at its first

meeting, in 1874 and 1875, it adopted a project of rules for international arbitral

°° For an account, see COLLINS, quoted supra footnote 5, 23: “In the modern law the primary function of
provisional and protective measures is to preserve the integrity of the final judgment, but there are
historical grounds for seeing their origin in the desire of those administering the law to prevent violent
self-help, as in some of the interdicts of Roman law, and the sequestration of the Middle Ages” [footnotes

procedure. The main principle contained in its Réglement indicated that the procedural
conduct of any arbitration should derive from the agreement between the parties in the
compromis or, subsidiarily, the decision of the arbitrator(s).“° These two sources, with
the addition of others*’ depending on each specific case, still constitute the basis for
ascertaining any power / duty of arbitral tribunals, including the issuance of provisional
measures. It has to be noted, however, that the time for specific provisions on the

measures subject of this study had not come yet.

B.Lii. General attempts at codifying international arbitral procedure did not meet with
success in the literature for quite a long period, even after the Convention for the pacific
settlement of international disputes entered into force, thereby establishing the
Permanent court of arbitration in 1899: in most cases, recourse to international
arbitration depended upon an ad hoc agreement. In general, these agreements were very
restricted. Still in 1945, Kenneth Carlston, a prominent author in the field, could write —

referring to inter-State arbitration — in the American journal of international law that

“Codification of established international arbitral procedure, through establishment of a uniform
code of procedure, does not seem likely to furnish an answer for all procedural problems. The
statement of rules upon which there can be a general agreement among states will inevitably

tend to be confined to those very points where problems are least likely to arise”.

However, the development of arbitral practice seemed to manifest the appropriateness
for its regularisation. Such a process was partly achieved through the establishment of
the Permanent court of arbitration referred above, still existing and active today.

Its name is misleading,” since it is not a permanent court, i.e. it is composed of
facilities for the appointment of arbitrators on an ad hoc basis. The only permanent

organs are the permanent international bureau and the administrative council. Indeed, its

name was even more misleading in earlier times, when it was placed side by side with
another imprecise term: it was also referred to as “the Hague Court”, particularly before
the establishment of the Permanent court of international justice, for intuitive reasons.

It exists, since its creation, under two conventions, that of 1899 and that of 1907 to
which a protocol was attached in order to allow an extension of the participant States.
Short of reducing its role as a means for the peaceful settlement of disputes and — as a
consequence — the development of international law, it has to be underlined that its
nature consists, in and of itself, in a sort of agreement to agree between States: the
Parties to the convention agree to the power to insert, of course if they so wish, in their
subsequent agreements a clause providing for arbitration under the auspices of the PCA.
In other words, the mere fact of ratifying the convention at issue means only that
another instrument to solve potential disputes concerning further agreements or other
legal issues — depending on the source — is at disposal of the States parties thereto. It is
anticipated that such a mechanism is analogous to the one provided by the Convention
for the settlement of investment disputes between States and nationals of other States,
establishing the ICSID arbitral option.

For the purposes of the present inquiry,” suffice it to say that the originary arbitration
rules did not provide for specific norms regarding provisional measures. In the words of
Professor Guggenheim, an eminent specialist of this procedural institution in

international law:

“En raison de la conception qui prédomine dans la doctrine du droit international public selon
laquelle les mesures provisoires constituent des intrusions particulierement sensibles dans le
domaine de la souveraineté des Etats, il est naturel que celles-ci n’aient été admises que fort tard

: : : » 51
dans la pratique internationale”’.

Besides, it is to be added that, in broader terms, the Hague Conferences did not

constitute an occasion for the development of international arbitral preocedure:** though

a “step forward”,”® they contributed in a fashion so to crystallize the idea that — in case
of absence of specific procedural provisions in the compromis, arbitrators may adopt
such rules that they deemed appropriate for the conduct of the proceedings, therefore
endorsing the view expressed some twenty-five years earlier in the Réglement of the

Institut de droit international.**

B.Liii. The institution of provisional measures appeared for the first time in inter-State
arbitration’’ on the occasion of a convention concluded on 20 January 1902 between
four central american republics, namely Costa Rica, Honduras, Nicaragua and
Salvador.°° Also known as the “Corinto”’ peace system” under the name of the venue in
which the respective Presidents met and concluded the treaty, its main purpose was that
of maintaining peace in a particularly animated and conflictual area of the world.
Reminiscent of the first Hague convention of 1899,°* it established a quite flexible

peace-keeping and military allegiance system wherein the four governments

“Will aid each other with military force, if necessary, in maintaining the status quo, and that the

peace in Central America is thus reasonably assured by making revolutionary efforts more

difficult and less liable to achieve success”.””

Since the setthkement mechanism provided for by the treaty consisted in compulsory
arbitration — to a certain extent, an oximoron — its nature may be controversial if the
treaty included the right of private parties to bring claims against any State party
thereto: the arbitral tribunals established on this basis may be considered internal and
parallel adjudicating organs of each State party, therefore deprived of any international
character. In this case, instead, since only States were entitled to file claims to the
tribunal, its existence in the international legal order could not be questioned. Under the

perspective of compulsory arbitration, in addition to the mixed private — public

character of the parties, consideration will be further given to the nature of the Iran —
United States claims tribunal.”

Art. 11 of the Corinto convention contained the provision whereby States parties
mutually agreed that — in case a dispute arose between them — they would not act in any
hostile manner against each other through the use and mobilisation of their military

troops:

“Los gobiernos de los Estados en disputa se comprometen solemnemente a non ejecutar acto

alguno de hostilidades, aprestos bellicos e movilizacién de fuerzas, a fin de no impedir el

arreglo de la dificoldad 0 cuestion, por los medios establicidos en el presente convenio”.

Therefore, the first provision dealing with modern-era provisional measures in
international arbitration contained an exclusively negative obligation, 1.e. the obligation
not to modify the status quo, to abstain from any hostile act.

Borrowing a term adopted by Toraldo-Serra in this respect, it consisted of a purely
“international self-provisional measure”, © an intrinsically out-of-court operation
whereby States parties to the dispute autonomously contributed to the conservation of
peace until the dispute itself was settled by the collective adjudicating body. It is
important to take note of the fact that another eminent international lawyer, Giancarlo
Venturini, opposed the view according to which art. 11 of the 1902 treaty constituted a

provisional measure for the very reason that the provision pertained to a group of norms

having a provisional aim which could be adopted directly by the Parties. On this point,

Guggenheim decided to adopt a more cautious stance, abstaining from expressing his
views on the nature of art. 11.
For the sake of clarity, it is worth noting that art. 11 led the way to a two-fold

application, as will be seen hereinbelow in the case comment related thereto:

1) The first step consists in the international self-provisional measure;
2) Lacking the appropriate non-hostile behaviour provided for by the article at
issue, the arbitral tribunal seised of the dispute decides whether any provisional

measure 1s required (“arbitral provisional measure’).

In 1906, a revolution takes place in Honduras, allegedly instigated by Nicaragua.
Military troops of the former State invaded — in order to capture the revolutionaries —
the territory of the latter, which demands reparation for the damages caused by said
action.

The dispute was brought on | February 1907 before an arbitral tribunal sitting in El
Salvador.” Having verified the situation, the tribunal, acting under art. 11 of the
Corinto convention, declared that the two parties had to withdraw their troops within
their respective territories in order to allow the tribunal to discharge its duty. While
Honduras complied with the provisional measure, Nicaragua refused to act accordingly.
Its main objection lied in the interpretation of said article: according to Nicaragua, that
provision did not attribute to the arbitral tribunal any authority whatsoever to issue a
provisional measures. In our scheme, the defense of Nicaragua was based in the
inexistence of point 2) above, i.e. in a State consent in the convention only insofar as
point 1) (international self-provisional measure) is concerned. Quite needless to say, no
room was left for the inherent-power nor the implied-power theories.

On 8 February 1907, proceedings were discontinued, due to the outbreak of the war

between the two disputants.

B.Liv. A fascinating international dispute settlement mechanism, though and perhaps

because it never operated, was the International prize court. Indeed, the Convention

convened in The Hague on 18 October 1907 for its creation never entered into force,
due to the lack of any ratification.°’ Its object was to regulate and settle situations of
naval capture in times of belligerence.

According to its article 51,°° claims could be brought by States parties to the convention
and nationals of a party to the convention against another State party thereto.°’ Thus, its
architecture consisted in a mixed framework, wherein private parties could directly
bring claims against States of which they were not nationals, with its implications in
terms of nature of the tribunal and the legal order concerned as will be dealt with
further.”

This aspect deserves great consideration, due to the innovations it bore on the
subjectivity of private parties in international law. Indeed, for the first time the
institution of diplomatic protection was theoretically set aside: parties would be left free
to have recourse to the adjudicating body, decide and organise the strategy as far as the
influence on the handling of the proceedings, the issues to be treated and the manner in
which they would be treated is concerned.

The exercise of presenting the main elements of this court and the consideration of its
most significant implications is deemed not only appropriate, but even necessary, if one
considers that this passage in the history of arbitration is constantly neglected in current
literature in the area of international investment arbitration. This fact is quite curious,
since this court is the antecedent not only to the ICSID system as will be showed below,
but of each and every mixed institutional and ad hoc arbitration, be it conducted under
the ICC, LCIA, Stockholm or UNCITRAL rules.

Undoubtedly, the inexistence of cases dealing with the rules provided for by the
international prize convention does not deprive the latter of their theoretical relevance in
the evolution of the rules concerning our theme, nor of their practical influence in

subsequent arbitral application.

A collateral damage caused by the abovementioned negligence consists in the fact that
certain authors of the following generation dealing with the complex issues of the nature
of these types of arbitration, indeed some of the finest minds in international legal
literature, are equally being neglected and risk being left behind. A clear example
thereof — though of course not exclusively — is given by the figure of Simon Rundstein.
In his series of lectures delivered at the Hague Academy of international law in 1928”
on the nexus between private law and international law and on the legal standing of the
individual within the international community, he appropriately underlined that the
great innovation introduced by the International prize convention, namely the
recognition of legal standing to the individual against foreign States, did not have any
impact on the failure of the convention: indeed, the reasons which led to the lack of
ratification related to the uncertainty about the applicable rules of international maritime
law.”

Moreover, the United States in particular opposed the fact that the Court, as an appeal
instance, could review and potentially annul judgments issued by national tribunals.”
The latter element gives an additional evidence to the international nature of the court.

It will be useful to refer to such an element when we will further address Anzilotti’s
theory of the internal and dual nature of these courts, though they are established by an
international instrument such as a treaty.’” Other italian scholars later followed his

views, notably Giancarlo Venturini in his study “Le misure cautelari nel diritto

internazionale and Nicola Toraldo-Serra in his “Le misure provvisorie

internazionali”.’°

Signatory parties were concerned, as indicated in the preamble, by the need to take into
account both private and public interests in occasion of a naval war in matters of prize:
therefore, the intention was to establish an international system’’ which would have
functioned as an appeal court with respect to national judgments in these matters.

According to art. 2

“Jurisdiction in matters of prize is exercised in the first instance by the prize courts of the
belligerent captor.
The judgments of these courts are pronounced in public or officially notified to parties

concerned who are neutrals or enemies’.

As far as provisional measures are concerned, though the convention did not provide for
an express regulation concerning such an incidental mechanism, the court might have
had” the authority to issue such measures by reference to either the inherent-power
theory or the implied-power one. Neither of the two theories might have been
acceptable by a purely positivist mind, as for instance Professor Anzilotti, since it is

evidently related to the idea of the existence of general principles of law in national

™ VENTURINI (GIANCARLO), quoted supra footnote 63, 16 f.: “Anche per i tribunali arbitrali misti,
costituiti dopo la grande guerra, mi sembra si debba negare il carattere di giurisdizione internazionale. La
questione pero non ¢é affatto pacifica e anzi tanto Dumbauld che Guggenheim sono di parere contrario a
quello che ho esposto”.

7° TORALDO-SERRA, quoted supra footnote 62, 48 ff.: “Oltre che da tribunale internazionale, cioé da
giudice tra due persone giuridiche internazionali (e si sa che tali in linea di massima sono solo gli Stati),
la Corte [referring to the Central american court of justice, A/N] funzionava pure da tribunale interno, in
quanto competente nelle questioni tra uno dei cinque Stati ed un semplice cittadino (sprovvisto percid
della personalita giuridica internazionale) di uno Stato firmatario ed in quelle fra 1 vari poteri dentro
ciascuno Stato”. It is interesting to note that the auhor, when dealing with the issue of the legal
personality of certain peculiar courts, referred in his note 54 to some criminal courts, such as the
Nuremberg and Tokyo tribunals and their historic antecedent, namely the “International Criminal Court”
provided for by the Geneva Convention dated 16 November 1937 and never ratified. The latter expression
met with greater success in more recent times, after the 1998 Rome Statute entered into force in 2002 and
established a universal court of the same name.

™ Art. 1: “The validity of the capture of a merchant ship or its cargo is decided before a prize court in

accordance with the present Convention when neutral or enemy property is involved”.

’8 As already mentioned, the court never began its works: therefore, it is not possible to ascertain whether
it would have upheld any of the two theories, or neither.

legal orders which may — under certain circumstances — be reproduced in the
international sphere.”

The difference between the two theories lies in the fact that the first one disregards in a
particular fashion the concept of attribution of power to an adjudicating body: in other
words, the idea is that the power to issue provisional measures is inherent in the judicial
function, complementary — one may argue, ancillary — to its adjudicating task.
According to the second theory, on the other hand, such power derives to a certain
extent from the implied attribution of States in their agreement, which in fact remained
silent on that specific aspect though it is presumptively considered as attributed in order
to let the court accomplish its function. Indeed, in the second theory the consensualistic
approach is at least sketched.

Another basis on which provisional measures come into play — although indirectly —

consists in the provision of art. 3, according to which

“The judgments of national prize courts may be brought before the International Prize Court:
1. When the judgment of the national prize courts affects the property of a neutral Power or
individual;
2. When the judgment affects enemy property and relates to:
(a) Cargo on board a neutral ship;
(b) An enemy ship captured in the territorial waters of a neutral Power, when that Power has
not made the capture the subject of a diplomatic claim;
(c) A claim based upon the allegation that the seizure has been effected in violation,
either of the provisions of a Convention in force between the belligerent Powers, or
of an enactment issued by the belligerent captors.
The appeal against the judgment of the national court can be based on the ground that the

judgment was wrong either in fact or in law”,

This jurisdictional provision shows the relationship with the judgment of national
courts: as any court of appeal, the International prize court may adjudge and declare that
the judgment of the first court was wrong either in fact or in law regarding either the

property of a neutral power (para. 1), or that of an enemy power (2). Therefore, a

national judgment confirming the legal validity of a provisional measure issued by the
court itself and causing a damage to the appellant before the International prize court
may be reviewed and potentially reversed by the latter.

In conclusion, the International prize court constituted a spes of mixed tribunal and a
major indication of the idea that the feasibility of this sort of private — public settlement

mechanism should not be discarded, as the subsequent practice demonstrated.

B.I.v. Another dispute settkement mechanism created in 1907 — which though met with
more success —, the same year as the International prize court, was the Central american
court of justice. It was the first permanent international tribunal of the modern era: a
fundamental step in the evolution of the service of justice and peace for subsequent
generations.

It was created by the Convention for the establishment of a Central american court of
justice, dated 20 December 1907 °° Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and
Nicaragua were the States parties to the convention, which provided for a final term of
ten years starting from the date of the last ratification, namely that of Guatemala on 11
March 1908.

A particular aspect is that the court was empowered with the authority to hear not only
inter-State cases, but also the first mixed — private / public — disputes wherein the
private party could not be a national of the respondent State.*!

It consists of a quite brief existence in a highly instable area, due to frequent
provocations and tensions between those States. Indeed, political instability and the
inadequateness of a court of law to solve that sort of disputes are the main reasons of its
failure.

However, some relevant aspects concerning provisional measures shall not be
unnoticed. First of all, it has to be underlined that for the first time a standing
international court was expressly empowered to issue these measures: indeed, article

XVIII of the convention provided that

“From the moment in which any suit is instituted against any one or more governments up to
that in which a final decision has been pronounced, the court may at the solicitation of the
parties fix the situation in which the contending parties must remain, to the end that the

difficulty shall not be aggravated and that things shall be conserved in statu quo pending a final

decision”’.

This provision gives many indications concerning the early conception of the institution
in international procedure:

°

1- “From the moment in which any suit is instituted...”: at the outset, the article
provides for the initial temporal limitation for a request for provisional measures
to be considered by the court, 1.e. there had to be a previous or concomitant
filing of application instituting proceedings before the court itself. It has to be
noted that such a temporal aspect was later substantially reproduced — after a
thorough examination conducted by the Advisory committe of jurists — in art. 41
of the Statute of the Permanent court of international justice and then confirmed
in 1945 in the same article of the Statute of the International court of justice.
Such a limitation, though quite intuitive, is by no means the only possible option
as we will see below in relation to administered investment arbitration under
certain fora.

Concluding on the temporal element, one may also note that there is an
additional indication, referring to the final term before which an application for
provisional measures had to be filed with the court: “up to that in which a final
decision has been pronounced”, 1.e. before the court issued its judgment (in view
of the overall provisions of the convention, and in particular of art. XXIII about
the distinction between final and interlocutory decisions, “final decision” has the
same meaning of “judgment”). By this provision, the drafters stressed another

peculiar feature of provisional measures which will be found in all subsequent

norms, namely the instrumentality of these measures in relation to the final

disposition of the case.*°

“Any suit”: as it has already evoked supra,** the court could hear both inter-
State and mixed disputes: therefore, this expression means that also private
parties could request provisional measures “against” States, thus quite
surprisingly — considering the period — impacting on their sovereignty in a

special fashion.

“The court may [...] fix the situation”: through the adoption of the term “may”
the drafters clearly manifested the intention to attribute discretionary power to
the adjudicating body. Again, this term was later reproduced in the Statutes of
the PCIJ and the ICJ.

“At the solicitation of the parties”: interestingly, the clear terms of the article
seem to suggest that proprio motu provisional measures were not permitted.
However, it has to be borne in mind that such a conclusion is not necessarily the
only correct one: indeed, it depends on the overall conception of provisional
measures in dispute resolution. As a matter of fact, the abovementioned
expression may be subject either to a restrictive interpretation (1) or to an
extensive one (II) as far as interpretation of State obligations is concerned.

Under (1), if one takes stock of the famous Lotus formula,*° according to which
any limitation of sovereignty is not presumed, the automatic conclusion shall be
that, since art. XVII of the convention does not provide for proprio motu

measures, the latter are excluded.

®° They cease to exist at the same moment in which the judgment is issued.

“The rules of law binding upon States therefore emanate from their own free will as expressed in
conventions or by usages generally accepted as expressing principles of law and established in order to
regulate the relations between these co-existing independent communities or with a view to the
achievement of common aims. Restrictions upon the independence of States cannot therefore be
presumed”. Such a dictum constitutes a major result of the positivist theory prevailing at the time (of
which Prof. Anzilotti, judge of the Permanent court in the case at stake, was one of the leading figures).

Under (II) instead, if one establishes the interpretation upon the principle of the
effet utile’’ — also expressed through the Roman maxim ut res magis valeat
quam pereat — (s)he will conclude that, since States decided to exercise their
sovereignty in limitating the latter through a delegation of power in favour of
adjudicating bodies whose main function is to restore peace by rendering a just
and effective judgment, a necessary consequence thereof is that these bodies
shall be automatically empowered to adopt those instruments allowing them to
accomplish their function. It is deemed appropriate just to briefly anticipate that
this idea constitutes the ground for the theory of implied powers.

Furthermore, in a broader perspective, one may ask what is the effect of a treaty
provision in the context of the body established thereby (and, in general, in
relation to customary international law): does it mean that the parties have
expressed the intention to create a norm which did not exist previously in
international law (restrictive: 1)? Or does it mean, on the contrary, that the
parties have intended to confirm — for instance, for the sake of clarity — a norm
which already exists in international law (extensive: IT)? We will address this
general issue further, after having added other appropriate aspects with the aim

of replying thereto.

“In which the contending parties must remain” [italics added]: the adoption of
this term in lieu of the less compelling may or might seems to provide for the
binding — instead of recommendatory — force of provisional measures issued by
the Central american court of justice. However, such a contention shall be
confronted with the provision of article XXV of the convention, whereby only
the judgments are expressly mentioned as binding on the parties, thus seemingly

excluding interlocutory decisions ex art. XXTII.**

°7 According to the Oxford Encyclopaedic Dictionary of International Law, the effet utile is “a form of
interpretation of treaties and other instruments derived from French administrative law which looks to the
object and purpose of a treaty, as well as the context, to make the treaty more effective”. Is has to be
noted, however — as the source itself does — that such a principle is particularly applied in the european
system of economic and political integration, which has characteristics of its own.

6- “To the end that the difficulty shall not be aggravated and that things shall be
conserved in statu quo pending a final decision”: the final part of the article

simply reminds the main purposes of provisional*’

measures. It may be added
thereto that the broad term “things” permits an extension to both rights in
dispute and means through which the protection of the latter can be achieved,

namely evidence.

After these remarks, it is appropriate to draw on a brief presentation of a case dealt with
by the court in order to see the law-in-action part regarding provisional measures in this
historical passage. Reference is made to the first contentious inter-State case, namely
Honduras y. El Salvador and Guatemala.”° Tensions, allegedly caused by the
respondents, led Honduras to file an application instituting proceedings on 10 July
1908. Three days later, the court, apparently acting proprio motu,’ issued provisional
measures ordering’’ respondents to halt military actions. The addressees did not abide
by the orders. In its award dated 19 December 1908, the court — addressing the function

of art. X VIII of the convention, concerning provisional measures — found that

“4. The function assigned to this Court by article XVIII... of arresting... the course of an armed
conflict by determining, from the very moment a claim is filed, the situation in which the
contending governments are to remain pending the rendition of an award, presupposes the right
to have recourse to the court without delay in matters of urgency, as occurred in the case under
consideration, and if we accepted the above-mentioned view of the matter, the humanitarian and
unquestionably utilitarian purpose for which this important article was inserted would be
essentially frustrated, the article being reserved perhaps for emergencies of minor risk and

significance or converted perhaps into a simple expression of wish”.

In these lines, though objectionable insofar as there seem to be an unclear hierarchy

between values having an apparent impact on the force of provisional measures, the

of the measure (i.e., provisional) and the purpose thereof (1.e., conservatory).

court referred to one fundamental condition for the granting thereof, namely urgency. It
constituted an early indication of the potential utility of this institution. The last two
cases before the Central american court of justice will be discussed further in the
following subparagraph (vi), since they concerned the interpretation and application of
one of the Bryan treaties, namely the one between the United States and Nicaragua (the

so-called “Bryan-Chamorro treaty”).

B.Lvi. The Bryan treaties”’ constitute a fundamental step forward in the gradual
provision for provisional measures in international adjudication. Indeed, for the first
time this institution was expressly provided for in detail: an evolution, if one compares
it with art. 11 of the 1902 Corinto convention” and with art. XVIII of the 1907
Convention for the establishment of a Central american court of justice.”” As already
mentioned, their history is interrelated with that of the latter court, since it had the
venture of applying a version thereof in two occasions. Before discussing these cases
(concerning the interpretation and application of art. 4 of the Bryan-Chamorro treaty), it
is deemed appropriate to take one step back to a brief account of the drafting of the
provision.

As a matter of fact, it is more precise to refer to a plural body of treaties, which became
known under the name of the U.S. Secretary of State’’ who promoted their ratification
with central american as well as european and asian countries: their “core business” 1s
almost always the same — the maintenance or re-establishment of peace through the
operation of commissions of inquiry or other dispute settlement mechanisms — but the
specific provisions concerning provisional measures and other aspects differed with one
another. It has been noted that the practice of inserting provisions regarding provisional
measures as relevant elements of a peace-keeping process could benefit from the

experience before the Central american court of justice.’’ The main idea was that these

commissions could operate only in a context wherein the disputing parties refrained
from having recourse to war pending examination: to this end, provisional measures
were a key tool.

Since commissions of inquiry pursue(d) mainly — if not exclusively — a fact-finding
mission, these measures necessarily had to focus on the preservation of evidence, one of
the purposes for which they are generally addressed today (the Bryan-treaty context is
the antecedent thereof).

Bryan treaties may be divided into two groups, which interestingly can be described
through the two-fold application which I have presented above”® in relation to art. 11 of
the Corinto convention, namely the distinction between “international self-provisional
measures” and “arbitral provisional measures”. Undoubtedly, the second version
theoretically provides for a more intense safeguard of the status quo.

The two groups consist of the following:

1) Art. 4 of the treaties bilaterally concluded between the United States and
Nicaragua (Bryan-Chamorro treaty, which will be further addressed in the
evaluation of the last two cases before the Central american court of justice),

Guatemala, El Salvador, Panama and Iran provides that

“Pending the investigation and report of the International Commission, the High
Contracting Parties agree not to increase their military and naval programs, unless
danger from a third power should conceal such increase, 1n which case the Party feeling
itself menaced shall confidentially communicate the fact in writing to the other
Contracting Party, whereupon the latter shall also be released from its obligation to

maintain its military and naval status quo”;

2) Art. 4 of the treaties bilaterally concluded between the United States and China,

France and Sweden provides that

“In case the cause of the dispute should consist of certain acts already committed or

about to be committed, the Commission shall, as soon as possible, indicate what

°8 Supra, 56.

83
Provisional Measures in International Investment Arbitration
Ph.D. Thesis — Federico Lenci

measures to preserve the rights of each party ought in its opinion to be taken

provisionally and pending the delivery of its report”.

The provision of the first group resembles the wording of art. 11 of the Corinto
convention: the parties apparently do not exercise their sovereignty through the
attribution of the power to issue provisional measures to the tribunal. As a consequence,
it constitutes an acknowledgment of the out-of-court exercise thereof and an agreement
not to modify the status quo pending examination by the commission of inquiry.

The second element, on the contrary, consists of an express attribution of such a power
to the arbitral tribunal. Moreover, there is an evolution also in terms of the legal
subjective position of the arbitral tribunal itself, since the wording of the article suggests
that it is more complex than a mere power: it also consists of a duty (“shall”). Such a
power / duty exerts a somehow soft, recommendatory effect on the addressee party,
since the binding force of the decision” seems to be excluded (“indicate”, “ought in its
opinion to be taken”). It is of utmost relevance to note that this provision played a

significant historic role as antecedent to the text of art. 41 of the Statute of the

Permanent court of international justice. '””

The last two cases before the Central american court of justice'®’ concerned the
application of the Bryan-Chamorro treaty, concluded between the United States and
Nicaragua. The treaty regarded the construction of a canal between the Atlantic and the
Pacific Oceans.

In the Costa Rica v. Nicaragua case,'”’ Costa Rica contended that Nicaragua lacked
capacity to conclude a treaty with the United States due to a previous obligation it had

103

entered into with Costa Rica,'’’ to which the Bryan-Chamorro treaty'°* was partly

conflicting. The court on 1 May 1916 applied art. 4 of the treaty at issue and requested

the parties to abstain from modifying the status quo pending a final disposition of the
case; which was pronounced some months thereafter, on 30 September 1916. Nicaragua
did not accept the decision.

In the E/ Salvador v. Nicaragua case, the former alleged that its rights in the Gulf of
Fonseca were impaired by the Bryan-Chamorro treaty. The application instituting
proceedings was filed on 28 August 1916, therefore the two claims brought against
Nicaragua were contemporaneous. In its judgment dated 9 March 1917, the court found
that Nicaragua had violated El Salvador’s rights.'°° Nicaragua equally as in the previous
case rejected the judgment and in April that same year denounced the convention which

had established the court: that episode rapidly caused the experience to cease to exist.'"°

B.L.vii. The mixed tribunals established by the Treaty of Versailles contained certain
peculiarities and advancements with respect to other earlier attempts. Short of
addressing each of these aspect, the presentation is limited to the analysis of the main

elements bearing relevance for the purposes of this inquiry, namely :

1) The legal standing of the individual and its impact on the nature of the arbitral
tribunal;

2) The force of the provisional measures issued thereby.

A clear example of the distinction with previous instances — as far as the legal
standing of the individual is concerned — is constituted by the comparison with the
fragile mixed nature of the International prize court established by the 1907 Hague
convention. |””

2. By a neutral individual, if the judgment of the national court injuriously affects his property
(Article 3, No. 1),'”* subject, however, to the reservation that the Power to which he belongs
may forbid him to bring the case before the Court, or may itself undertake the proceedings in his

place” [footnote added, A/N].

As the provisions indicates, private parties did not have a firm legal standing before that
court, since their national State party had the authority to prevent them from appearing

as claimants in two ways:

I) by excluding such a power on an opt-out basis through a reservation or;

II) by taking the claim on the behalf of their nationals, 1.e. diplomatic protection.

For the sake of completeness, it 1s noted that such a fragility was not present with
respect to private parties having the nationality of enemy States.”

Post-WW1 mixed-dispute systems were based both on the Treaty of Versailles as a
chapeau and on a bilateral treaty (a winning State on one side, a losing State on the
other). Therein, private parties having the nationality of a State party to the bilateral
treaty at issue could not be barred from claiming compensation against the other State
party, contrary to the system provided for by the International prize court.

In relation to the nature of mixed tribunals, it has already briefly introduced the theme
of the doctrinal dispute.''° Two main opposed ideas are confronted: according to the

positivist classical school — in particular but not exclusively, the italian scholars Danilo

'8 Art. 3, No. | provides that “The judgments of national prize courts may be brought before the

International Prize Court: 1. when the judgment of the national prize courts affects the property of a
neutral Power or individual”.

' «Art. 4. An appeal may be brought: [...] 3. by an individual subject or citizen of an enemy Power, if
the judgment of the national court injuriously affects his property in the cases referred to in Article 3, No.
2, except that mentioned in paragraph (b)”. Art. 3, No. 2 provides as follows: “Art. 3. The judgments of
national prize courts may be brought before the International Prize Court: [...] 2. when the judgment
affects enemy property and relates to: (a) Cargo on board a neutral ship; (b) An enemy ship captured in
the territorial waters of a neutral Power, when that Power has not made the capture the subject of a
diplomatic claim; (c) A claim based upon the allegation that the seizure has been effected in violation,
either of the provisions of a Convention in force between the belligerent Powers, or of an enactment
issued by the belligerent captors.

The appeal against the judgment of the national court can be based on the ground that the judgment was
wrong either in fact or in law.

Ml and Giancarlo Venturini'!? — these tribunals lack the character of

Anzilotti
international jurisdiction, though they derive the source of their existence from public-
international-law instruments, such as the treaties, and by operation of members of the
international community.

Indeed, in perfect line with the dualist theory, these treaties derive their binding force
within the national legal order of the State by operation of their reception by an internal
act of the State itself. Moreover, according to Giancarlo Venturini, another evidence
supporting the thesis which denies such an international character to mixed arbitral
tribunals is given by the Permanent court of international justice: the world court
refused to admit an exception of res alibi pendens with a mixed arbitral tribunal ruling
that “les tribunaux arbitraux mixtes et la Cour permanente de justice internationale ne
sont pas des juridictions du méme ordre”.!"°

Such a doctrinal position is contrasted by those''* who see the problem in an
evolutionary perspective, i.e. the gradual emancipation of the individual in the
international legal order, at the same time proposing a distinction to be made between
subjects of international law — whenever private parties are enabled to bring a claim
against a foreign State, as in the case of mixed arbitral tribunals — and members of the
international community (condition uniquely held by States). Two prominent Professors
of international law, on the occasion of the cours généraux that they delivered at the
Hague Academy of International law in 1930 and 1937, expressed their views on the

subject with clarity. The first of the two, Séfériadés, addressing the broader theme of

access of the individuals to international justice, maintained that

“La question de l’acces direct des particuliers aux juridictions internationales se pose comme un

probleme auquel on devrait chercher non point une solution d’occasion, mais une solution de

The second in time, Sir Hersch Lauterpacht, considering the progress of international
law towards the protection of individual rights, asserted that a private person is a direct

M6 oF in

subject of international law whenever the latter directly regulates its conduct
cases of procedural capacities in mixed disputes.''”

Reference has also to be made to a third option: according to Blihdorn, mixed arbitral
tribunals play a sort of hybrid role, i.e. in certain instances they act as international
dispute settlement organs, whereas in other ones such as in the matters covered by
articles 296 and 297 of the Treaty of Versailles they constitute part of the internal legal
order of the State concerned.''* This last conception has not been followed in legal
literature; in any case, it should be abandoned, since it does not give any clear indication
of the respective fields and in addition it fails to take account of the abundance of
common elements in both “fields”: therefore, it is respectfully submitted that it is
inappropriate to properly describe the phenomenon.

The more convincing theory seems to be the internationalist one: it is easier to maintain
it today in 2014 than eighty or more years ago, due to the post-Westphalian shift that
may be indicated — obviously with a certain approximation, as is always the case when
one tries to fix a point in time when major changes occurred — in 1948 with the
Declaration of human rights as will be further discussed in the part concerning the
sources.

Concerning point 2) of this subparagraph, namely the issue of the force of provisional
measures issued by mixed tribunals, early doubts — later reproduced within the ICSID
framework as will be seen — arose as to whether they were empowered to issue binding
orders, or whether they were deprived of such power due to the respect which had to be
paid to the Sovereign and its prestige.

The theme of prestige in favour of the restricted-power thesis related to the mixed
tribunal as well: an hypothetical case in which an order issued by the tribunal were not

complied by the addressee (more probably, by the Sovereign) may be considered a

deminutio of the authority of the adjudicating body and therefore warranted a cautious
approach in this respect.”

Having reviewed the case law of these mixed tribunals in relation to provisional
measures, one can say that both positions find application in the relevant arbitral
practice.

Upholding the idea of the binding force of these measures, the Anglo-German arbitral

tribunal presided by Borel laconically ruled in 1922 that

“Le Tribunal arbitral mixte a qualité pour ordonner des mesures provisoires” [italics added,

AN].

A first series of cases had consolidated a quite consistent practice on this issue, due to
the fact that the potentially high political impact of these measures was reduced by the
fact that the addressee were always the States which had lost WW1'*' and therefore did
not enjoy a broad marge de manoeuvre. Curiously indeed, there had been a proliferation
of provisions on these measures which found their source in the rules of procedure
established by the arbitrators themselves (they were thus deprived of the direct
attribution by the State(s) concerned).

Such a situation rapidly changed when these measures started being directed to the
winning States or their nationals. The most famous case in this respect is constituted by
the decision issued by the Hungaro-Romanian mixed tribunal presided by Mr. von
Cedercrantz in the Ungarische Erdgas S. A. c. Etat roumain. The Government of
Romania objected to the binding force of provisional measures for concerns of

sovereignty, which the tribunal rejected noting that

“On ne saurait comprendre comment une mesure ordonnée par ce tribunal, dans les limites de ce
pouvoir, puisse étre qualifiée d’atteinte a la souveraineté de l’Etat défendeur ou de blame envers

lui; que l’on ne saurait comprendre non plus la these suivant laquelle une condamnation au fond

'l? As will be further discussed, this idea is pernicious, since it unreasonably mixes up two different
elements: on one side, the nature of the provisional measure; on the other, the subsequent problem of its
enforceability.

respecterait la Souveraineté, tandis qu’une simple injonction d’avoir a maintenir un certain état

de fait y porterait atteinte et constituerait méme une blame”.'”

The argument according to which provisional measures are less intrusive in State
sovereignty than judgments and therefore, if the State consented to attribute jurisdiction
to an adjudicating body, there is no reason to argue that it did not attribute to it a less
intrusive power such as that of provisional measures, is ever-young, recurring very
often in arbitral practice. Its main weak point in arbitration dealing with a State is found
in the first pages of the foundational study by Professor Guggenheim. The author,
known for being an adversary of their binding force — though not based on a priori —
distinguished between the internal legal order and the international one. The first is
intrinsically founded on the idea of subordination: therefore, there is no deminutio of
sovereignty or prestige. In a community of entes superiorem non recognoscentes, on the
contrary, such a power would be able to affect State sovereignty and, consequently,

constitute a potential threat to international peace and security. In his words,

“La vie politique interne de |’Etat admet tres bien, et en dehors méme du domaine
<<technique>> de la procédure civile, des mesures provisoires destinées 4 sauvegarder une
situation juridique actuelle ou a venir. Les sujets de droit sont habitués a ces interventions. Dans

un ordre juridique reposant sur la subordination, elles n’impliquent aucune diminution de

: r : 123
<<souveraineté>> ou de <<prestige>>”.

Furthermore, provisional measures are able to destabilise the political aequilibrium of a
State more than a judgment, due to lasting and modifiable effect of the former, whereas
a judgment — although it may constitute a blow to its international stance — can be
handled with more ease as it is represents a point in time.

In addition to it, it 1s submitted that provisional measures can be systematised in a
gradual scale in two order of respects, namely 1) type;'”* 2) class.

Point 1) is intuitive.

As far as point 2) is concerned, we may distinguish two classes of provisional measures:
I) static (for instance, to maintain the status quo);
IT) dynamic (for instance, to annul the effects of a State decree which is affecting a
foreign enterprise).
Arguably, the first class of provisional measures are less impacting on State sovereignty
and, perhaps, they imply a minor risk for the arbitral tribunal to appear as pre-judging
the merits of a case.
Turning back to case law, after the change which followed the decision of the Hungaro-
Romanian mixed tribunal, subsequent tribunals tended to be more cautious, with the
intention to avoid impinging on State sovereignty. For example, in the Frauenverein
Szamothlie c. Etat polonais case, presided by Mr. Guex, the German-Polish mixed

time had come for the establishment of a world court having the broadest possible
jurisdiction in order to constitute — within the ambit of peaceful means — a valid
alternative to diplomatic instruments fot the settlement of disputes between States. The
intention of the drafters of the project leading to the creation of this principal judicial
organ of the League of Nations was not to challenge the authority of the Permanent

court of arbitration instituted in the previous generation, but rather to multilateralise

judicial means through a veritable standing court and, consequently, a more consistent

jurisprudence as a tool for achieving greater legal security and predictability.

Short of addressing a broad panorama of issues related to the operation of the
Permanent court of international justice (established in 1922),

the relevant provision of its statute concerning provisional measures and the case law

related thereto.!7’

According to art. 41 of the Statute,

“The Court shall have the power to
indicate, if it considers that the
circumstances so require, any provisional
measures which ought to be taken to
preserve the respective rights of either
party.

Pending the final decision, notice of the
measures suggested shall forthwith be

estime que les circonstances |’exigent,
quelles mesures conservatoires du droit
de chacun doivent étre prises a titre
provisoire.

En attendant l’arrét définitif, l’indication
de ces mesures est immeédiatement
notifiée aux parties et au Conseil”.

the idea is to focus on

given to the parties and the Council”.

The purpose of this synoptic presentation of the text of art. 41 in the two official
versions of the statute is to show that there is a slight difference in terms of force of
provisional measures.'”* Indeed, the term “ought to be taken” seems to be less
compulsory than “doivent étre prises”; in addition, a clearer indication of the fact that
the English version was drafted in a more deferential fashion in this sense is given by
the second paragraph of the article at issue, wherein reference is made to measures
which are “suggested”, whereas in the French version there is no such soft expression.

The International court of justice stated in the LaGrand case that the two texts were not

no. 35, Issue no. 3, 1922, 245 ff. and — by the same author — the periodic annual reviews of the activities
of the Court, published in the American journal of international law until its twenty-third year (1945),
except for the first year which was published in the Harvard law review.

drafting history of the relevant provisions on provisional measures, see GUGGENHEIM, quoted supra
footnote 51, 56 ff; ROSENNE, quoted supra footnote 3, 21 ff. and bibliographical references contained
therein.

English texts of the provision, the English-speaking world being inclined to follow the English version in
which the element of obligation is less emphatically expressed”.

in “total harmony”.'”” Prior to that, the first reference thereto was made by Judge ad hoc

Thierry in the Arbitral Award of 31 July 1989 case.'°°

Provisional measures consist of a power of the court, which is by no means
unconditional: indeed, it does not have such power in each and every occasion, but “if it
considers that the circumstances so require”. As a consequence, following the meaning
of the provision, the court could exercise its discretion through consideration of its
connected duty to assess whether the circumstances for granting the latter where met.

It has to be added that, since there is no express reference to any list or hint whatsoever
of the type of circumstances which might have guided / limited the court, it is to be
inferred that the contracting parties intended to invite the court to develop its own
jurisprudence on this point, by means of the application of the provision in the specific
cases which would have been filed with it. This aspect relates once again with the
complex and general issue of the relationship between art. 38 (1) lett. d and art. 59 of
the Statute of the World court, namely the role of judicial precedent and — more broadly
— judicial law-making in combination with the absence of a stare decisis principle, as
expressed in the latter article.

Another duty derives from the above interpretation of art. 41: in addition to the duty to
assess whether the circumstances were met in the specific case, the court also had the
duty to express its assessment in the decision, therefore justifying the reasons for which
it considered that it had the power to issue provisional measures. Concluding on the
point of the duty of the court in this aspect, it is submitted that the same applies with
regards to the decision of the court to deny a request for provisional measures.
Moreover, there is no list of the type of provisional measures which can be granted,
illustrating the principle of atypicalness.'*’

As far as the second paragraph of art. 41 is concerned, the obligation to notify the
Council of the League of Nations seems to be mostly of a procedural nature and — in
addition — unable to have an impact on the validity of the measures. In case of denial

thereof, there is no obligation to notify such decision.

Provisional Measures in International Investment Arbitration
Ph.D. Thesis — Federico Lenci

It is worth noting that these considerations are maintained in relation to the subsequent
International court of justice, since the text of the Statute was substantially reproduced
in its integrality, except for the reference in the second paragraph of art. 41 to the

Security council instead of the Council of the League of Nations, for intuitive reasons.

It has already been noted that the text of this article historically derives from art. 4 of

the Bryan treaties with China, France and Sweden:'**

“The Court shall have the power to
indicate, if it considers that the
circumstances so require, any provisional
measures which ought to be taken to
preserve the respective rights of either
party.

Pending the final decision, notice of the
measures suggested shall forthwith be

“In case the cause of the dispute should
consist of certain acts already committed
or about to be committed, the
Commission shall, as soon as possible,
indicate what measures to preserve the
rights of each party ought in its opinion
to be taken provisionally and pending the
delivery of its report”.

given to the parties and the Council”.

However, the first part of the two articles differs: in art. 41 of the PCIJ Statute reference
to the temporal framework in which these measures can be issued is lacking. The
Bryan-treaty version was manifestly linked to the main concern for which provisional
measures were provided for, namely the risk of the use of force pendente lite. Actually,
on the occasion of the Drafting Committee’s twenty-eight meeting on 20 July 1920,
Raul Fernandes, one of its members, had successfully proposed to reproduce the
provision contained in the Bryan treaties in its integrality. However, later on Professor
Ricci-Busatti, italian representative thereto, finally managed to persuade the majority
that the temporal limitation at issue should be removed, in order to extend the breadth of
provisional measures. '*°

Another element shall be added to the analysis of the force of provisional measures
before the Permanent court of international justice, namely the reference to a passage in

the travaux préparatoires to this article (report of the Committee) wherein the intention

not to attribute binding force to these measures — therefore respecting State sovereignty

— 1s clearly expressed:

“There is no question here of a definite order, even of a temporary nature, which must be carried
out at once. Great care must be exercised in any matter entailing the limitation of sovereign

powers. It is sufficiently difficult to ensure compliance with a definite decision; it would be

much more difficult to ensure the putting into effect of a purely temporal decision” .'™*

It is respectfully submitted that a distinction shall be drawn between the nature of a
decision for provisional measures and its enforceability, which the Committee
apparently did not do. The above lines exerted an extremely powerful influence on the
idea that these measures did not have a binding character, until the revirement
manifested in the LaGrand case. Throughout the jurisprudence of the court, the leading
view was that provisional measures were not binding; such a position was — except for
certain relevant exceptions — reproduced in legal doctrine.'*°

An analysis of the most relevant aspects concerning provisional measures before the
Permanent court of international justice follows. All cases in this respect are reviewed.
In order to facilitate the fruition of the cases and the understanding of the most relevant
aspects concerning these measures, such an analysis will be conducted through a
schematic reference to: - facts (background and object of the request); - law
(jurisdictional condition, 1.e. prima facie jurisdiction / fumus bonae iurisdictionis, and
substantive conditions, i.e. urgency, necessity, risk of an irreparable harm and prima
facie bonum ius | fumus boni iuris) - decision.

However, before starting, it is deemed necessary to provide the reader with two general
indications, which are valid also in relation to the analysis of the jurisprudence of the

International court of justice as will be seen:

I. As far as the abovementioned substantive condition is concerned, it has to be
borne in mind that the totality of those elements is almost always lacking in the

individual case; however, it is useful for didactic purposes to keep all them

' Thid., 735.

Ph.D. Thesis — Federico Lenci

united in the title: in certain cases element A and element B will be present, in

others C and D or any other possible combination of the four elements;

II. Some fresh expressions are adopted in order to try to better describe the gradual
character of each condition: in all of these cases, the adoption of “prima facie”
means a more relaxed requirement of intensity, whereas the “/umus” means that
the condition in the specific case had to meet a higher threshold in the
interpretation given by the court.

They are quite easy to grasp, in the sense that the former is presented in the
negative (“it cannot be excluded that...”), whereas the latter is presented in the
positive (“it is probable that...”). Such an exercise is useful in order to describe
tendencies and dominant positions.

To put it simply, let us make an example adopting the jurisdictional condition.
We will refer to “prima facie jurisdiction” in cases in which the Court decided
that the test for granting provisional measures was that the existence of its
jurisdiction could not be excluded through an ictu oculi assessment (at first
sight). On the contrary, we will adopt the fresh expression “/fumus bonae
iurisdictionis’ 1n cases in which the Court decided that, instead, the test for
granting provisional measures was that the existence of its jurisdiction was
probable through an ictu oculi assessment (the “first-sight” requirement is

unchanged due to its connection with urgency).

In line with the overall thesis maintained in the present research, the harmonisation of
the presentation of the historic evolution of provisional measures in public international
law, together with the comparative analysis thereof, with chapter 3 dealing with the
current status of provisional measures in international investment arbitration will
demonstrate the interrelatedness of these factors and thereby construe a stable

architecture.

The Sino-Belgian case’

A. Facts

Background

On 3 January 1927 the Belgian Government filed an application instituting proceedings
against the Chinese Government, following denunciation by the latter of the Treaty of
friendship, commerce and navigation (FCN, also known as the genus of “capitulation
treaty”; mutatis mutandis, it consists of the antecedent of bilater investment treaties —
BITs) concluded between the Parties on 2 November 1865.

The dispute concerned the effect of a Presidential order whereby the President of China
denounced the FCN treaty, claiming that as a consequence the latter ceased to be
effective. The Belgian Government, on the contrary, opposed such unilateral withdrawal

from the FCN treaty, maintaining that the latter was still in force.’°’

Object of the request

The object of the Belgian Government’s request for provisional measures contemplated
the preservation of the status quo ante pending the dispute before the Permanent court
of international justice in relation to the situation of Belgian nationals in China, which
had been altered by the aforementioned Presidential order.'°* In the words of the
adjudicating organ, “the object of the measures of interim protection to be indicated in

the present case must be to prevent any rights of this nature from being prejudiced”.'*’

B. Law

Jurisdictional condition - prima facie jurisdiction / fumus bonae turisdictionis

As a premise, undoubtedly a perfect separation between facts and law does not
correspond to reality in international adjudication: therefore, reference will be made
when appropriate to the facts relevant to the assessment of jurisdiction to issue
provisional measures (whether prima facie or fumus).

In this case, interestingly the President , Judge Max Huber,’*° did not rule on the
jurisdictional condition, deferring the decision on a final evaluation of jurisdiction to a
later stage: “ [...] indicates provisionally, pending the final decision of the Court in the
case submitted by the Application of November 25th, 1926 — by which decision the
Court will either declare itself to have no jurisdiction or give judgment on the

merits”. !*!

Substantive conditions - urgency, necessity, risk of an irreparable harm and prima

facie bonum ius /fumus boni iuris

No reference whatsoever is made in the Order to any of the abovementioned substantive

conditions.

C. Decision

President Huber provisionally indicated, pendente lite, the specific type of protection for
each of the following categories: Belgian nationals (individuals, missionaries and
private persons accused of a crime), property and shipping, judicial safeguards.”

He did not pronounced himself on the force of the provisional measure indicated.

'° Before the amendment to the rules of procedure in 1929, art. 57 thereof provided that the President had

the power to indicate provisional measures without the necessity to convene a meeting of the judges of
the court. For obvious reasons, the President lacked the power to rule definitively on the jurisdiction of
the Court to hear the case on the merits.

Mention is made, instead, to the power of the adjudicating organ to modify the content
of the provisional measure (and, arguendo, to revoke it): “subject to any modification
which it may subsequently be considered desirable to make in the present Order”.'*°

It has to be noted that the President of the Court subsequently decided to revoke the
provisional measure upon request of the Belgian Government, since the latter had

reached an agreement with the Chinese Government.'**

The Chorzow Factory case (indemnities)'*

A. Facts

Background

On 8 February, the German Government filed an application with the Registry of the
Court, claiming indemnities for certain acts allegedly attributable to Poland and for
which compensation was requested, under the rules of general international law on State
responsibility for injury to aliens.

In the case at stake, the dispute concerned conduct in regard to the Oberschlesische

Stickstoffwerke and Bayerische Stickstoffwerke (hereinafter, Bayerische).

Object of the request

There had allegedly been expropriation without compensation, for which the German
Government requested the Court “to indicate to the Polish Government that they must
pay to the German Government as a provisional measure the sum of thirty million of

Reichsmarks within one month from the date of the Order sought”.'*° It is worth noting

that in this case the request for provisional measure concerned a positive act, instead of
the typical negative one, namely the abstention from act in a manner prejudicial to the
other party, or liable to have an adverse impact on the rights of the parties or to extend
the dispute: “The origin of the provisions of Article 41 of the Statute shows that not
only an omission by the Parties but also a definite act was considered as the subject of a

measure of protection” .!*”

B. Law

Jurisdictional condition - prima facie jurisdiction / fumus bonae turisdictionis

The Court had already definitively established in a previous judgment that it had
jurisdiction to hear the merits of the claim: “Whereas the Court, in Judgment No. 8, by
which it declared itself to have jurisdiction to give judgments upon the merits in the

Substantive conditions - urgency, necessity, risk of an irreparable harm and prima

The German Government emphasized that the time of payment of the compensation had
a great impact on the prejudice caused to it, maintaining that monetary compensation
would be unable to constitute a full reparation,'*’ due to the adverse influence not only
on the position of Bayerische in the international markets but also its national economic
situation. In the words of the Agent for Germany, “if 1t were necessary to wait for this
judgment, further opportunities for economic reconstruction which have meanwhile
arisen could also not be made use of”.'°’ A peculiar relationship which is frequently

manifested in practice is the one between urgency and necessity: in fact, the second

requirement is to a certain extent contained within the first one. In other words, if the
requirement of urgency is not met, then that of necessity is automatically subjected to
the same fate.

As far as risk of an irreparable harm is concerned, the Agent for Germany addressed the
issue in the following terms: “seeing that the prejudice caused by a further delay would
actually be irreparable, the German Government consider that an interim measure of
protection whereby the Court would indicate to the respondent Government the sum to
be paid immediately, as a provisional measure and pending final judgment, is essential
for the protection of the rights of the Parties, whilst the affair is sub judice”.'?' In a
nutshell, it referred to the fact that time was adversely impacting the very capability of
Bayerische to continue being competitive in the market. For the reasons set below
(decision), the Court decided not to address any substantive condition, either

theoretically or in the specific case at hand.

C. Decision

The Court declined to grant the request of the German Government, since it considered
that it did not relate to the indication of provisional measures, but rather to obtain an
interim judgment upon a part of its claim, therefore outside the scope of art. 41 of the

Statute.!°?

For this reason, the Court did not deem it appropriate to address the question
whether the substantive conditions for provisional measures were present in the case.
Furthermore, it is noted that it also decided that the principle of contradictoire, namely
asking the Polish Government to submit its observations in that respect, was not

The South-Eastern Territory of Greenland case’™

A. Facts

Background

On 18 July 1932, the Norwegian Government instituted proceedings against the Danish
Government in relation to the legal status of certain parts of the south-eastern territory
of Greenland.'”°

The subject of the dispute was the legal validity of the occupation of certain areas

proclaimed by a Norwegian Royal decree.'”°

Object of the request

The application of the Norwegian Government requested the Court to adjudge and
declare — on the merits — that the abovementioned Norwegian Royal decree was legally
valid under international law (therefore recognising Norwegian sovereignty over the
disputed territory); on a provisional basis, it requested that the Court order the Danish
Government to abstain in that territory from conducting any coercive measure against
its nationals, i.e. the classic provisional measure of a negative, protective, character.’

Interestingly, the applicant added that the request could be provisionally stayed, had the

Danish Government decided to provide the latter and the Court with assurances about

sovereignty of Norway — effected by the Royal Decree of July 12th, 1932 — is legally valid, and that
accordingly the said territory is subject to the sovereignty of Norway”, but also “to decide forthwith to
order the Danish Government, as an interim measure of protection, to abstain in the said territory from
any coercive measure directed against Norwegian nationals”. Furthermore, at page 17 of the Order, the
Court observed that “the object of the Norwegian request for the indication of interim measures of
protection was to cause the Danish Government "to abstain from any measures of violence or force
against Norwegian nationals" in the territory in question”.

its cooperative intentions.'°* Another peculiar aspect of the Norwegian request is that
the latter considered that it should be applied equally to both parties.’””

On the other hand, the Danish Government reserved its right to request provisional
measures for the protection of its rights in dispute.'®°

The Court ruled that “the object of the measures of interim protection contemplated by
the Statute of the Court is to preserve the respective rights of the Parties pending the
decision of the Court, in so far, that is, as the damage threatening these rights would be

irreparable in fact or in law”.'®!

B. Law'”

Jurisdictional condition - prima facie jurisdiction / fumus bonae turisdictionis

Since both Parties had filed applications instituting proceedings against each other —
whereby each Party was at the same time claimant and respondent, as the Court had
decided to join the proceedings — there was no doubt about the existence of the Court’s
jurisdiction to rule on the merits.

It has to be noted that the court wished to express its view on the issue of its proprio
motu power to issue provisional measures: “whereas, moreover, the Court is satisfied
that it may proceed to indicate interim measures of protection both at the request of the

Parties (or of one of them) and proprio motu”.'®

'°8 Tbid., 15: “Whereas, nevertheless, in his letter of July 18th, 1932, transmitting the application to the
Court, the Norwegian Chargé d'affaires at The Hague requested the Court, in pursuance of instructions
from his Government, "to defer its decision upon the request for interim measures of protection, should
the Danish Government inform the Court that it will not adopt coercive measures".

'° Tbid., 18: “The Norwegian Government accordingly agrees that the request for the indication of
interim measures of protection which it formulated in its application of July 18th, 1932, should be
understood as referring equally to both Parties to the present proceedings”.

Statute and Article 57 of the Rules of Court, should circumstances require it, for the indication of interim

'®3 Thid., 20. Finally, the Court found that the circumstances did not require any proprio motu provisional
measure, in consideration of the conduct of the Parties and of the fact that there was no risk of irreparable
harm (25).

Ph.D. Thesis — Federico Lenci

Substantive conditions - urgency, necessity, risk of an irreparable harm and prima

facie bonum ius /fumus boni iuris

On the issue of necessity, the Danish Government declared that “the Norwegian
application for interim measures of protection is without any justification”; '™*
furthermore, it indicated that its previous conduct did not justify the Norwegian
concerns expressed in the request for provisional measures. In this case it is possible to
see the interrelation between necessity and urgency: lacking the former, a fortiori the
latter does not need to be explored.’

On the substantive condition of irreparable harm, an agent for the Norwegian
Government specified the unavailability of monetary compensation in order to restore
the status quo ante, i.e. a basis for the claim for the substantive condition of irreparable
harm: “whereas M. Sunde pointed out in his statement that the object of the Norwegian
request was "to prevent regrettable events which it might be impossible to make good
simply by the payment of an indemnity or by compensation or restitution in some other
material form"”.'°°

In addition to it, the Danish Government maintained that the request was groundless due
to the failure of the applicant to demonstrate a connection between rights in dispute and
object of the request,’®’ ie. the substantive condition of the fumus boni iuris in this
presentation.

The Court agreed with the Danish Government, as the applicant had not shown that the
prejudice it wished to avoid through an order for provisional measures concerned the

safeguard of its alleged right.'°**

possesses no right in the territory in question capable of forming the subject of a measure of protection”.
'®8 Thid., 21: “Whereas, moreover, the incidents which the Norwegian Government aims at preventing
cannot in any event, or to any degree, affect the existence or value of the sovereign rights claimed by
Norway over the territory in question, were these rights to be duly recognized by the Court in its future
judgment on the merits of the dispute; and as these are the only rights which might enter into account”;
“Whereas, accordingly, so far as concerns the Norwegian request for the indication of interim measures
of protection, no Norwegian rights the protection of which might require the indication of such measures,
are in issue”’.

Case Concerning the Administration of the Prince von Pless'”’

A. Facts

Background

The context in which a request for provisional measures made by Germany in relation
to an allegedly unlawful act committed by Poland concerned a tax dispute. On 18 May
1932 the German Government filed an application against the Polish Government on an
alleged violation by the latter of certain obligations incombent upon it under the Geneva
convention of 1922 concerning Upper Silesia.'”! The Prince von Pless was a Polish

national belonging to the German minority in Polish Upper Silesia.

Object of the request

By a document dated 2 May 1933, the Agent for the German Government requested the

Court “to indicate to the Polish Government, as an interim measure of protection,

pending the delivery of judgment upon the Application of May 18th, 1932, that it
should abstain from any measure of constraint in respect of the property of the Prince
von Pless, on account of income-tax” [italics added, A / Ny.” In fact, the Polish
Taxation Office had served Prince von Pless with a warrant of payment of a certain sum
of money, accompanied by the information that — had the Prince failed to pay that
amount — measures of constraint would be applied. Therefore, claiming that such

German Government requested the classic provisional measure of a negative character,
relating such request with the rights in dispute pendente lite before the Court.

annulled the abovementioned warrant and that it would stay measures of constraint in
respect of the Prince von Pless for the time during which the dispute would be pending
between the Parties, thus adhering to the request.'”*

Having the German Government informed the Court that it agreed with the conduct of
the opposing Party as far as the issue of provisional measures was concerned and was
therefore ready for a settlement of the latter, the Court took note of that stance and
concluded that, since there was an agreement for the settlement of the question, the
request for provisional measures made by the Applicant had accordingly become

would have been admissible.

Substantive conditions - urgency, necessity, risk of an irreparable harm and prima

facie bonum ius /fumus boni iuris

In his application, the Agent for Germany substantiated his request for provisional
measures by referring to the requirements of necessity, risk of irreparable harm and
urgency. Concerning the first two elements, he maintained that “the carrying into effect
of the above-mentioned measures of constraint would irremediably prejudice the rights
and interests forming the subject of the dispute", whereas concerning the third one, he
underlined the fact that the warrant was accompanied by the “threat” (sic) that fifteen
days after the date of notification of the warrant (20 April + 15 days = 5 May, 1.¢. 3 days
after the date of the request for provisional measures), had the amount requested not
been paid, measures of constraint would have been applied, thus rendering the
application urgent.)””

For the same reasons set out above, the Court did not pronounce on the substantive

conditions.

C. Decision

Having taken note of the written statements of both Parties and in particular of their

agreement, the Court delared that the request ceased to have any object.’

Case Concerning the Polish Agrarian Reform and the German Minority!”

A. Facts

Background

On 1 July 1933 the German Government brought a suit '*°

against the Polish
Government concerning the agrarian reform which the latter had started to carry out
since 1925 on a territory — Posnania and Pomerelia — inhabited by landowners of both
Polish (the majority) and German origin (the minority).

After WW1, as part of the agreements arising out of the Treaty of Versailles — including
the treaty between the Parties prohibiting discrimination against the German minority —
Germany was obliged to cede those territories to Poland.

In its application, the Agent for the German Government described the subject of the

dispute as follows:

“The German Government holds that the Polish Government has acted inconsistently with the
obligations assumed by it under Articles 7 and 8 of the Treaty of June 28th, 1919 [1.e., the
Treaty of Versailles, A / N] by discriminating against Polish nationals of German race of the

voivodeships of Posnania and Pomerelia, in the carrying out of its agrarian reform”.

The German principal claim is reported below in its formulation, since its interpretation
constituted a fundamental element for the decision of the Court on the indication of

interim measures:

“The German Government requests the Permanent Court of International Justice to declare that
violations of the Treaty of June 28th, 1919, have been committed to the detriment of Polish

: : 182
nationals of German race and to order reparation to be made”’.

Indeed, the German Government alleged that the Polish Government, in carrying out its

program of agrarian reform, had committed acts of discrimination against the German
minority by conducting an unproportionate rate of expropriations in their respects, as

compared to those conducted in relation to property owned by the Polish majority.'*°

Object of the request

Together with the abovementioned application instituting proceedings, the Agent for the
German Government filed an application for provisional measures, requesting the Court
“to indicate interim measures of protection in order to preserve the status quo until the
Court has delivered final judgment in the suit submitted by the Application”.'™*

Subsequently, at the hearing held on 19 July 1933, he specified the content of the
measure requested: the Polish Government should abstain itself from I) including
members of the German minority in the lists for expropriation; IT) proceeding with the
expropriations of members of the German minority already included in the lists; III)
transfer estates taken from members of the German minority to other persons, or
establish settlers upon such estates (as by doing so, the Polish Government would have
been in the position to technically circumvent the prohibition to expropriate properties

owned by members of the German minority).'*

the German minority in the nominal lists for expropriation, that it should not proceed with the
expropriation of the estates of members of the German minority included in nominal lists already
published and that it should not transfer to other persons estates taken from members of the German
minority, or establish settlers upon such estates”.

Jurisdictional condition - prima facie jurisdiction / fumus bonae turisdictionis

On the principle of contradictoire, it is worth noting in this case the following series of

events:

¢ the Acting-President of the Court convened, according to art. 57 of the Rules of
Court, a hearing for 11 July;

¢ the Polish Government asked the Court to postpone the hearing until the end of
the month;

e the Court denied the request;

e the Polish Government stated that — notwithstanding its intention — it was unable
to present its observations at the hearing;

¢ The Court, at the hearing of 11 July, merely adjourned until 19 July the hearing
on the request for provisional measures;

e A hearing on provisional measures took place on 19 July.

Therefore, the Court finally had to accede, though partially and at a later stage, to the
Respondent’s request to be granted additional time to present its defense on its

opponent’s request for provisional measures. '*”

Provisional Measures in International Investment Arbitration
Ph.D. Thesis — Federico Lenci

As far as competence to decide on provisional measures, the present case gives an
additional indication that the question shall be considered only if the conditions for the
granting thereof are met: in this case, as will be seen below, the substantive condition —
which the Court termed as essential — absorbed any other issue concerning provisional
measures, including the jurisdictional condition: “without in any way pre-judging the
question of its own jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the German Government's
Application instituting proceedings, or the adrnissibility of that Application [...]”.'**
The same was stated for the issue of proprio motu provisional measures: “irrespective
of the question whether it may be expedient for the Court in other cases to exercise its
power to act proprio motu”.'*’

It is worth noting that Judges Schiticking and van Heysinga expressed their disagreement
with such a statement: “They are even of opinion that, if no Member of the Council had
made a request for interim measures of protection, the Court should have indicated such
measures proprio motu, availing itself of the powers conferred upon it by Article 41 of
the Statute (see also Art. 57 of the Rules of Court)”!”’. Interestingly, they argued that
the power to order provisional measures also consists of a duty for the Court (“the Court
should have indicated such measures proprio motu’): this duty is construed as a

declination of the more general duty of any adjudicating body to guarantee the good

administration of justice.

Substantive conditions - urgency, necessity, risk of an irreparable harm and prima

facie bonum ius /fumus boni iuris

On the connection between the rights in dispute and the object of the request for
provisional measures, the Court stated that “the essential condition which must
necessarily be fulfilled in order to justify a request for the indication of interim
measures, should circumstances require them, is that such measures should have the
effect of protecting the rights forming the subject of the dispute submitted to the Court”

Thus, it is of utmost relevance to define: 1) the rights in dispute; 2) the object of the
request for provisional measures.

The Court understood that 1) concerned German Government allegation that the Polish
Government had acted in violation of the Treaty of Versailles by discriminating against
Polish nationals of German origin and — consequently — asked reparation for the acts
committed (italics added on purpose, for the reasons set out below).’”"

On the other hand, as far as 2) is concerned, the provisional measures requested related
to future acts, namely violations — however allegedly — that the Polish Government had
not committed yet.'””

The Court noted that the effect of upholding such a request “would result in a general
suspension of the agrarian reform in so far as concerns Polish nationals of German race,
and cannot therefore be regarded as solely designed to protect the subject of the dispute
and the actual object of the principal claim, as submitted to the Court by the Application
instituting proceedings”.'”’ Thus, in the understanding of the Court, 1) and 2) were
unrelated.

For this single reason, namely the lack of connection between the rights in dispute (acts
already committed and directed to specific individuals) and the object of the request for
provisional measures (i.e. a general abstention from future acts in the application of the

agrarian reform), the Court dismissed the German Government’s request for provisional

measures. 14

'"! Thid., 6 f.: “Whereas, according to the terms of the Application instituting proceedings which have
been quoted above, the subject of the dispute is the contention of the German Government that the latter
Government has acted inconsistently with the obligations assumed by it under Articles 7 and 8 of the
Treaty of June 28th, 1919, by discriminating against the Polish nationals of German race in the
voivodeships of Posnania and Pomerelia, in the carrying out of its agrarian reform, particularly in the
application of the Polish agrarian law of December zSth, 1925, and other supplementary acts;

Whereas, on the basis of this contention, which is not admitted by the Polish Government, the German

the Polish agrarian reform law to the Polish nationals of German race and aims at securing an immediate
indication to the effect that henceforth, and until judgment has been pronounced, the said Polish law shall
not be applied in respect of the said nationals;

Therefore, through the adoption of such expressions, the Court established a hierarchy —
or, at least, an order of priority — between the connection “rights in dispute — provisional
measures requested” (at the top) and the other conditions, namely necessity, urgency,
risk of an irreparable harm and prima facie bonum ius — fumus boni iuris (for the sake
of clarity, the four are not presented in a hierarchical order between themselves, but
only in relation to the first one). This submission is confirmed by the fact that, after
finding that the essential condition was not met, the Court did not deem it opportune to
make any reference whatsoever to the other conditions.

It has to be underlined, however, that there was disagreement on the content of the
essential condition in practice: Judge Rolin Jaequemyns was favourable to an order for
provisional measures, since he estimated that, by so doing, reparation — so far as it was
necessary — would have been facilitated. He appended a dissenting opinion in this
respect.!”°
More significantly, Judge Anzilottt explained in greater detail the reasons for the
decision of the Court as they have been reported above. (It is noted incidentally that we
are here dealing with a dissenting opinion, though in our days it would be called a
concurring opinion, since Judge Anzilotti finally agreed with the decision of the Court
not to grant the measures requested, though for other reasons than those of the
majority.)'”°

He firstly noted that the expression in which the German claim was drafted was quite
unclear, namely on the question whether the claimant was asking for a declaration — and
a reparation connected thereto — limited to acts already committed (as strongly

contended by the Agent for Poland), or instead a broader one, in the sense that it

concerned the legality under international law of the Polish act enabling the agrarian

Whereas, accordingly, the interim measures asked for would result in a general suspension of the agrarian
reform in so far as concerns Polish nationals of German race, and cannot therefore be regarded as solely
designed to protect the subject of the dispute and the actual object of the principal claim, as submitted to
the Court by the Application instituting proceedings ;

Whereas, in these circumstances, the Court [...] confines itself to the statement that the request for
interim measures now before it is not in conformity with the provisions of Article 41 of its Statute,
Dismisses the request of the German Government for the indication of interim measures of protection.

reform at stake and thus encompassing also future acts. In this second, broader sense,
according to Judge Anzilotti the request would have been granted. He further added that
his observations, and in general the procedural situation of the Parties, did not prevent
Germany from broadening its claim accordingly and making a fresh request for
provisional measures.'””

Furthermore, Judges Schticking and van Heysinga appended a joint dissenting opinion,

contending that, since the agrarian reform was pursued through a continuous

'"7 Thid., 10 f.: “The only reason which, in my view, made it impossible for the Court to grant the German
Government's request, in the present state of the proceedings, was the uncertainty which the Application
instituting the main proceedings allows to subsist as to what the said Government seeks to obtain from the
Court, and, in consequence, as to the extent of any right; which the interim measures would have to
protect.

In the opinion of the Court, the proceedings instituted by the German Government were designed to
obtain a declaration that certain alleged infractions of the Treaty had been committed in individual cases,
in applying the agrarian reform law, and, further, to obtain reparation for the said infractions; such is
indeed the impression conveyed - at any rate, at first sight - by the wording used in the Application to
indicate the object of the claim: "to declare that violations of the Treaty of June 28th, 1919, have been
committed to the detriment of Polish nationals of German race, and to order reparation to be made". If
that is really so, it is manifest that the interim measures applied for would go far beyond the limits of the
right that is in dispute. Interim measures of protection would certainly have been possible and expedient;
but they would need to have been confined to the individual cases which the German Government had in
mind. And since neither the Application, nor the request for the indication of interim measures, made it
possible to ascertain which were these cases, the Court found itself unable, in practice, to indicate the
measures as requested.

But was that really the meaning of the German Application? Was not its intention rather to obtain from
the Court a declaratory judgment, to the effect that the Polish Govern- ment's conduct in the application
of the agrarian reform law was not consistent with its obligations under the Treaty of June 28th, 1919? In
other words, the issue is not - or is not only - this or that violation of the Treaty committed to the
detriment of this or of that Polish citizen of German race; the issue is the whole body of acts by which the
Polish authorities have applied the agrarian reform law ; and it is the inconsistency of the attitude,
resulting from this whole body of acts, with the Treaty of June 28th, 1919, that the Court is asked to
declare. If such was the object of the claim in the German Government's Application, it is quite
comprehensible that it should have asked - as an interim measure of protection - that the application of the
agrarian reform to Polish citizens of German race, in general, should be suspended.

I am inclined to think that that is really the meaning of the Application; more especially, because it would
seem incomprehensible that the Court should be asked to declare that violations of a treaty had been
committed, without the violations being specified: such an application would moreover be null and void,
owing to the complete absence of certainty as to the object of the claim.

But I must admit that the German Government's Application is open to different interpretations, and this
in regard to a point on which perfect clarity is essential. As it is only fair that a government should bear
the consequences of the wording of a document for which it is responsible, I could readily understand that
the Court should, on that ground, refuse to grant the request for interim measures of protection. This,
however, should not prejudice the German Government's right to submit a fresh application indicating the
subject of the suit with the necessary clearness and precisions, and to follow it up by a fresh request for
the indication of interim measures appropriate to the rights claimed”.

114
Provisional Measures in International Investment Arbitration
Ph.D. Thesis — Federico Lenci

administrative act, 1t was not correct to draw such a restrictive interpretation, thereby
denying the provisional measures sought by Germany on the ground that the latter were
not related with the rights in dispute.'”®

Finally, there is a hint of the substantive condition concerning the possibility /
probability of the effective existence of the right in issue (prima facie bonum ius / fumus
boni iuris i.e. the fourth substantive condition in my scheme) which shall not remain
unnoticed, also because of the fact that it has been pronounced by an authoritative
voice.” Indeed, in the first part of his dissenting opinion in the present case, the
eminent international lawyer stated that “If the swmmaria cognitio, which 1s
characteristic of a procedure of this kind, enabled us to take into account the possibility
of the right claimed by the German Government, and the possibility of the danger to
which that right was exposed, I should find it difficult to imagine any request for the
indication of interim measures more just, More opportune or more appropriate than the
one which we are considering”. As indicated above, he agreed with the majority on the
denial to grant the measure because the German Government’s claim was unclear.””°
Apart from this consideration, he advanced an indication of the degree to be regarded as
the minimum threshold for establishing that the bonum ius substantive condition (the
fourth in this scheme) is met: in one word, possibility. “Possibility of the right claimed”
means that the condition at issue has a negative character: indeed, if it cannot be

excluded that the right claimed may possibly exist, then the condition is met. In the

'°8 Judges Schiicking and van Heysinga joint dissenting opinion on the Order on provisional measures

quoted supra footnote 183, 15: “The effect of the interim measures would be, inter alia, to prevent any
expropriations which may have been previously initiated by entries in a nominal list, from being made
definitive - a contingency which is by no means hypothetical, as is shown by the cases instanced by the
German Government's Agent.

This conception of the subject of the dispute cannot be upset by deducing an interpretation of the
Application instituting proceedings - as the Polish Government's Agent has done - from the emphasis he
has placed on the past tense in the word "committed". Having regard to the continuous character of the
acts impeached, the undersigned consider that any attempt to read into the words formulating the object
of the dispute, in the Application instituting proceedings, a definite distinction between acts which have
already been accomplished and those which belong to the future, would be an utter distortion of the clear
meaning of the application. It would also be entirely inadmissible to construe the Application instituting
proceedings as meaning that it was the intention of the Member of the Council, who was impelled to draw
the Court's attention to the illegal character of certain previous entries in the nominal lists, to refrain from
contending that any action taken in the future to give effect to the expropriation already initiated was also
illegal”.

Bulgarian Government in order to protect the legal position of a Belgian company of
electricity against measures of constraint arising out of sums which the Municipality of

Sofia requested from the latter.

Object of the request

The request concerned an indication to the Bulgarian Government whereby new
proceedings pending at that time in the Bulgarian courts against the Belgian company
be suspended pendente lite before the Permanent court of international justice.°’° As a
matter of fact, the Municipality of Sofia had brought a petitory action against the

Belgian company.

The Court made no reference to the jurisdictional condition for a decision on

The substantive conditions of the present case were only briefly outlined by the Agent
for the Belgian Government. On the issue of necessity, he claimed that “whereas the
measures of execution with which the Belgian Company is threatened are such as would
not only seriously prejudice the Company's position but also impede the restoration of
its rights by the Municipality, if the Court were to uphold the Belgian Government's
claim’”,*”* adding that he had tried to persuade the Bulgarian Agent to intervine with a
view of suspending the Bulgarian courts’ proceedings.

counter-memorial) in order to prove the temporal priority of the order for execution to
be applied by the Municipality of Sofia with respect to a decision on the merits before
the PCIJ, had no provisional measure of protection been issued.”””

The Court agreed with the applicant and ruled that the indication of provisional

measures aimed at preventing prejudice to the rights of the latter.7””

C. Decision

Exercising its power provided for by art. 61, paragraph 4, of the Rules of Court to
indicate provisional measures other than those requested by the applicant, as another
manifestation of its power to issue proprio motu provisional measures, the Court
indicated that “pending the final judgment of the Court in the suit submitted by the
Belgian Application on January 26th, 1938,

the State of Bulgaria should ensure that no step of any kind is taken capable of
prejudicing the rights claimed by the Belgian Government or of aggravating or
extending the dispute submitted to the Court”.”"’

Such a decision is undoubtedly more deferential to the Sovereign than the indication to
suspend the proceedings in the Bulgarian courts, as requested by the Agent for the
Belgian Government.

The indication is composed of two poles, a positive one and a negative one:

P) the Government is invited — nothing more than that, in the present case — to actively
monitor the situation in order to intervene if necessary;

N) the Government is invited to prevent prejudices and aggravations of the dispute from

occurring.

° Tbid., 6: “whereas the Bulgarian Government, having regard to the international situation, has asked
the Court for an extension of the time granted for the filing of its Counter-Memorial, and there is thus
reason to fear that a decision on the merits will not be given before the order for execution applied for by
the Municipality of Sofia”.

delays and, finally, the action as demandant above mentioned, justify in the view of the Court the
indication of interim measures calculated to prevent, for the duration of the proceedings before the Court,

concerned, the respective rights which may result from the impending judgment”.

It is deemed appropriate to underline that 1t was the first time since its creation that the
Court — unlike the President of the Court alone as in a previous case,”’” before the
amendment to the Rules of Court in 1931 — had granted a request for provisional

measures.

B.L.ix. After the end of WW1, the Government of the United States created the
conditions for a new Convention between Central american States, in an effort to
continue the pan-american process, theorised by Simon Bolivar, of judicial settlement of

disputes started in 1907.7"

A conference to this end was held in 1923 in Washington, in
order to re-establish the Central american court of justice;”'* however, the approach of
the negotiators and their goals were more of a more limited scope: competence was not
attributed to rule on an essential core of sovereign issues, individuals were not granted
access before the Court (1.e., a purely inter-State system was established) and, finally,
the Court was not a permanent body (it was more similar to an arbitral tribunal).

In this framework, a right to issue provisional measures was provided for by art. XXI of

the Washington convention, according to which

“From the moment when in conformity with the provisions of Article VIII, a complaint has
been lodged against one or more of the contracting parties the tribunal shall have the right to
determine, at the request of any of the parties, the status in which the litigants must remain, to
avoid an aggravation of the dispute, and to maintain the case in statu quo until the final award is
pronounced.

For this purpose, the Tribunal shall have the right, if it should deem necessary, to make any
investigations, to order examinations by experts, to conduct personal inspections and to receive

any evidence”.

Statute of the Permanent court of international justice — necessity of the existence of a
dispute already pending before the adjudicating organ (“from the moment when [...] a
complaint has been lodged”).

In addition, the provision contains a reference to an activity by one or more of the
Parties relating to provisional measures, namely a request; as a consequence, a question
arises as to the interpretation of this expression in combination with the right of the
Court thereupon: it 1s submitted that the answer to it is — according to the textual
meaning — that no de officio power 1s attributed to the Court, since the request by one or
more parties constitutes a condition for the Court to exercise its (limited) right to issue
provisional measures.

Furthermore, art. XXI of the Washington convention expressly indicates the object of
such measures (arguably excluding atypicalness in this instance): the classic measure of
a negative character, whereby the status quo ante is maintained until a final award is
rendered on the merits.

Finally, on the force of these measures, the text states that the Parties must abide by the
latter, therefore indicating their binding nature.

In the second paragraph of the article there is the first connection in the history of
provisional measures in international adjudication between these measures and the
administration of evidence,”'* in order to protect each Party’s right to a just final

decision.

B.Lx. On 3 May 1923 an international agreement for the peaceful settlement of disputes
between american states was elaborated and ratified in the following years (though with
some exceptions), establishing the compulsory commission-of-inquiry procedure.

According to its article 1, paragraph 2,

“les parties s’engagent en cas de conflit 4 ne pas commencer les mobilisations et concentrations

de troupes sur les fronti¢éres, et a n’exécuter aucun acte hostile mi faire aucun préparatif

*1° Tt ig noted that according to VENTURINI (GIANCARLO), quoted supra footnote 63, 28, this provision

does not pertain to the group of provisional measures.

*!7 It may just be added that a right is so if the one who owns it is under no obligation to use it: therefore,
the Court is by no means compelled to issue provisional measures, even in cases in which the latter may
be appropriate, or even necessary.

binding nature, contrary to those contained in art. 11 of the Pact of the League of

Nations, which could indicate recommendations.

B.Lxii. In the arbitration treaties of Locarno, dated 1924, the Council of the League of
Nations was expressly given the power to order provisional measures: “dans tous les cas
et notamment si la question, au sujet de laquelle les Parties sont divisées, résulte d’actes
déja effectués, ou sur le point de I’étre, la Commission de conciliation ou, si celle-ci ne
s’en trouvait pas saisie, le Tribunal arbitral ou la Cour permanente de justice
internationale statuant conformément a l’article 41 de son statut, indiqueront dans le
plus bref délai possible, quelles mesures provisoires doivent étre prises. I appartiendra
au Conseil de la Société des Nations, s’il est saisi de la question, de pourvoir de méme a
des mesures provisoires approprices”’.

It is worth noting that the text resembles that of art. 4 of the Bryan treaties with China,
France and Sweden — and, as showed above, to the early draft of art. 41 of the Statute of
the Permanent court of international justice — as far as the temporal indication is

concerned.

°?? Short of meaning thereby that the measures not included in this group cannot have a clear contra
bellum character, it is simply indicated that such a purpose is in nuce in these provisions.

B.L.xiii. Lastly, before analysing in the following section the static part of provisional
measures before the International court of justice and so forth, it is deemed appropriate
to refer — though briefly — to art. 33 of the General Act of arbitration and conciliation
dated 26 September 1928, whereby in any case of disputes submitted to a judicial or
arbitral procedure and in particular when the latter arises out of acts already committed
or about to be committed, the Permanent court of international justice, acting under art.
Al of its Statute, or the arbitral tribunal having competence therein, will indicate the
provisional measures which ought to be taken. The addressee shall abide by them.

Contrary to art. 19 of the Locarno treaty, the Council of the League of Nations was not
attributed the power to issue provisional measures. One may wonder, however —
following Guggenheim’ - whether and, if so, to what extent rights and obligations
arising out of this instrument may have been modified for the Parties who were
members of the League of Nations; arguably, the addressee may have found itself
bound by both notwithstanding the juxtaposition, therefore it may have had to

harmonise the obligations deriving therefrom.

B.II]. Comparative analysis of the sources concerning provisional measures in

contemporary public international law
1) 1. Multilateral treaties. — 11. Regional treaties. — 111. Sectoral treaties. — iv. Bilateral investment treaties.
—v. Model bilateral investment treaties. — vi. Treatification and contractualisation concerning provisional

measures. — 2) vii. Institutional arbitration. — vii. Ad hoc arbitration rules.

After the historical analysis conducted in the previous paragraph, our differentiated
approach now turns to the comparative perspective, expressed through the image of the
circle.””* Actually, the idea of the circle is not that of a static and complete picture
concerning provisional measures in public-international-law adjudication: on the
contrary, the aim of this inquiry and its main achievement would be the construction of
a dynamic framework, as it is submitted that the latter better corresponds to reality. To
this end, it is deemed appropriate to present this special type of incidental proceeding
adopting a broad and reasonable radius.

In order to address both law and practice, this presentation of the sources is divided into
three main areas: 1) treaty law; 2) arbitration rules’; 3) general principles of law
recognised by civilised nations, as a mere ancillary basis from which relevant elements
can be drawn.

Short of maintaining that art. 38 of the Statute of the International court of justice
enumerates a complete list of the sources in public international law (for instance, but of
course not exclusively, unilateral acts are not contained therein), it is nonetheless argued
that this list can be adopted cum grano salis for the purposes of this inquiry on
provisional measures. In this sense, the first area corresponds to lett. a of art. 38 (1),

whereas the third one corresponds to lett. c thereof.*”°

Then, a question may arise: given
that art. 38 (1) is constituted by four areas, only two of which are represented above,
what about the other two? As far as lett. b 1s concerned — i.e. rules of customary
international law —, since we are dealing with rules of procedure which are constantly
applied by the pertinent adjudicating bodies, there is no place for custom. Concerning

lett. d, instead — 1.e. judicial decisions and doctrine — the issue is more complex. Indeed,

°24 Supra, 53.

°° It has to be noted that when arbitration rules are enshrined in a treaty — as is the case for the ICSID
convention — they are described within the treaty-law area.

°° The second area is not comprised in art. 38.

123
Provisional Measures in International Investment Arbitration
Ph.D. Thesis — Federico Lenci

judicial decisions play a fundamental role in this field: in addition to what has already
been sketched in paragraph A of this chapter, it is anticipated that the best way to
adequately consider such a source of law consists in making reference thereto in relation
to each of the three areas, as the judicial law-making throughout the interpretation and
application of, say, treaty law constitutes the dynamic side which upgrades the static
treaty text. At this stage of the presentation, the same can be said about the role of

doctrine.

1)

B.ILi. This part of the first area — treaty law — pertaining to provisional measures
concerns multilateral treaties. It 1s divided into three facets, namely the Statute of the
International court of justice, the United nations convention on the law of the sea and
the framework of the ICSID convention and arbitration rules.

The reason for the choice to focus on these facets is easily explained: regarding the first
two, they constitute the only existing adjudicating bodies having permanent stance in
public international law. The same cannot be said in relation to the Permanent court of
arbitration, which is not a permanent court, insofar as it is composed of facilities for the

appointment of arbitrators on an ad hoc basis.””’

a) The Statute of the International court of justice is annexed to the Charter of the
United Nations, of which it forms an integral part. This is the reason for its inclusion
within the static part relating to the analysis of multilateral treaties influencing the
current status of provisional measures in international investment law.

The relevant provision of the Statute in this respect is constituted by its art. 41, under

whose terms

“1. The Court shall have the power to indicate, if 1t considers that the circumstances so require,

any provisional measures which ought to be taken to preserve the respective rights of either

party.

27 See supra, B.Lii.

124
Provisional Measures in International Investment Arbitration
Ph.D. Thesis — Federico Lenci

2. Pending the final decision, notice of the measures suggested shall forthwith be given to the

parties and to the Security Council”.

This statutory provision is integrated and developed by the ancillary norms contained in
a specific subsection’”* in the rules of court expressly dedicated to provisional

measures, namely its articles 73 through 78, stating as follows:

“Article 73

1. A written request for the indication of provisional measures may be made by a party at
any time during the course of the proceedings in the case in connection with which the request
is made.

2. The request shall specify the reasons therefor, the possible consequences if it is not
granted, and the measures requested. A certified copy shall forthwith be transmitted by the
Registrar to the other party.

Article 74

1. A request for the indication of provisional measures shall have priority over all other
cases.

2. The Court, if it is not sitting when the request is made, shall be convened forthwith for
the purpose of proceeding to a decision on the request as a matter of urgency.

3. The Court, or the President if the Court is not sitting, shall fix a date for a hearing
which will afford the parties an opportunity of being represented at it. The Court shall receive
and take into account any observations that may be presented to it before the closure of the oral
proceedings.

4. Pending the meeting of the Court, the President may call upon the parties to act in such
a way as will enable any order the Court may make on the request for provisional measures to

have its appropriate effects.

Article 75

°8 Subsection | (“Interim Protection”) in section D (“Incidental proceedings”). It has to be noted that the
expression “interim protection” can be understood as a broader term comprising both the nature —
provisional — and the purpose — conservative — of the measures at issue.

Ph.D. Thesis — Federico Lenci

1. The Court may at any time decide to examine proprio motu whether the circumstances
of the case require the indication of provisional measures which ought to be taken or complied
with by any or all of the parties.

2. When a request for provisional measures has been made, the Court may indicate
measures that are in whole or in part other than those requested, or that ought to be taken or
complied with by the party which has itself made the request.

3. The rejection of a request for the indication of provisional measures shall not prevent

the party which made it from making a fresh request in the same case based on new facts.

Article 76

1. At the request of a party the Court may, at any time before the final judgment in the
case, revoke or modify any decision concerning provisional measures if, in its opinion, some
change in the situation justifies such revocation or modification.

2. Any application by a party proposing such a revocation or modification shall specify
the change in the situation considered to be relevant.

3. Before taking any decision under paragraph 1 of this Article the Court shall afford the

parties an opportunity of presenting their observations on the subject.

Article 77

Any measures indicated by the Court under Articles 73 and 75 of these Rules, and any
decision taken by the Court under Article 76, paragraph 1, of these Rules, shall forthwith be
communicated to the Secretary-General of the United Nations for transmission to the Security

Council in pursuance of Article 41, paragraph 2, of the Statute.

Article 7&
The Court may request information from the parties on any matter connected with the

implementation of any provisional measures it has indicated”.

As will be seen below, a significant part of these articles of the rules of Court are
nothing but the crystallisation of a sufficiently consolidated judicial practice of the
World Court.

Short of drawing an in-depth exegesis of the meaning of these provisions, it is deemed
more appropriate to show how the latter are interpreted and applied in the judicial

practice of the International court of justice. To this end, it is of utmost relevance to

126
Provisional Measures in International Investment Arbitration
Ph.D. Thesis — Federico Lenci

conduct such an analysis through the adoption of a thematic guide expressing the
elements which are reiterated, combined and sometimes subjected to revirements by the
Court.

In line with the structure and the overall thesis which is advanced in the present inquiry,
the same scheme which has served the purpose of explaining the salient aspects
concerning provisional measures before the Permanent court of international justice’””
is adopted herewith.

However, as far as the case analysis is concerned, it has to be anticipated that there is a
difference in the discussion of the two courts: indeed, while in the former — 1.e. the six
contentious cases before the Permanent court of international justice — the scheme was
applied on each individual case, in the latter the scheme will be used as a means to
group the key elements of our procedural mechanism in the assessment of the
contribution of all the cases analysed herewith altogether.

In other words, while in relation to the PCIJ each case was analysed from the beginning
to the end as separate from the other — of course, underlining the connections and
divergences with one another — regarding the ICJ each element of the scheme
constitutes a passage wherein all the cases analysed directly play with each other.

The reason for such a difference is, once again, two-fold: on one hand, if the same
approach was followed, the more abundant amount of cases would unduly distance each
element thereof and consequently render both the explanation and the understanding of
connections and divergences dramatically more difficult; on the other hand, the purpose
of thus singling out each of the relevant cases before the Permanent court of
international justice is to shed light to cases which are unjustly neglected in current
legal doctrine in this field.

For intuitive reasons, the subsection “background” of section A of the scheme will be
omitted; therefore, that section will be limited to “object of the request”. Undoubtedly,
specific factual indications of the background of the dispute at stake will be made
whenever appropriate for didactic purposes. In the same sense, section C (“decision”)
will only contain reference to the issue whether the measure sought by the applicant was

granted or not.

A. Facts

Object of the request

As we have already seen, atypicalness of provisional measures is a characteristic
procedural feature of the World Court, which was subsequently reproduced in the
ICSID framework. Its basis is contained in art. 41 (1) of the Statute, whereby the
Court shall indicate any provisional measures.

One of the most significant ratione materiae limitations — or instructions, on the basis
of the perspective — is provided for by the necessary connection between the rights in
dispute and the provisional measure(s) sought.

This constitutes a clear example of the phenomenon of crystallisation of a sufficiently
consolidated judicial practice in the World Court: indeed, said principle was firstly
expressed — as we have seen — by the Permanent court of international justice in the
Case Concerning the Polish Agrarian Reform and the German Minority, in which the
Court ruled that “the essential condition which must necessarily be fulfilled in order to
justify a request for the indication of interim measures, should circumstances require
them, is that such measures should have the effect of protecting the rights forming the

231

subject of the dispute submitted to the Court” [italics added, 4 / NJ]; such a condition

was so essential that it was subsequently inscribed in art. 73 (1) of the Rules of Court””

of the ICJ, which in its current version states that “a written request for the indication of
provisional measures may be made by a party at any time during the course of the

proceedings in the case in connection with which the request is made”.”*°

The first case?** under consideration in the present study arises from an application

instituting proceedings filed by the Government of Timor-Leste against Australia on 17

December 2013; that same day, the claimant also filed an application requesting
provisional measures for the preservation of its rights.”°°

The dispute arose out of intelligence activities conducted by agents for the Government
of Australia who attended an office of a counsel for Timor-Leste involved in a treaty
arbitration with Australia and seized documents from that premise. The seized
documents contained, inter alia, correspondence between the Government of the
Applicant and its counsel relating to the conduct of the abovementioned arbitration,
namely under the Timor Sea Treaty.

On the other side, the Government of Australia did not deny that such facts had ocurred.
However, it contended that the seized documents did not belong to Timor-Leste and
added that, even assuming that the documents removed belonged to the Applicant, there
is no general principle of immunity or inviolability of State property and _ that
consequently the rights asserted were not plausible. Thirdly, it maintained that even if
such a principle existed in international law, it would not be absolute, not applying were
the communications constitute a threat to national security or to the higher public
interests of a State.”*°

The Government of Timor-Leste circumscribed the object of its request for provisional
measures in two times (general / specific): firstly, 1t stated that they were (1) to protect
the rights of Timor-Leste in the documents and data seized; (11) to prevent their use by
Australia contrary to the rights and interests of Timor-Leste and (ili) to end the
impediment to the Applicant to properly defend its case before the treaty tribunal.”°’
Further, more specifically, it requested that the Court indicate to respondent (a) to
immediately seal and deliver the documents to the custody of the Court; (b) to
immediately deliver to claimant and the Court a list providing information as to the

documents disclosed or transmitted and the identities of those persons who may have

inspected those documents; (c) to deliver a list of the copies that it has made of any

seized document and data; (d) to destroy the copies, to make efforts to secure
destruction of the copies possibly transmitted to third parties and inform the Applicant
and the Court and (e) to give an assurance that it would not intercept either directly or
indirectly any communication between claimant and its legal advisers.”**

In addition, it has to be noted that the Applicant made a further request to the Court, of a
measure that may be called “pre-provisional”: indeed, according to art. 74, paragraph 4,
of the Rules of Court, “pending the meeting of the Court, the President may call upon
the parties to act in such a way as will enable any order the Court may make on the
request for provisional measures to have its appropriate effects”. In other words, the
President of the ICJ is empowered to “recommend” (a binding nature has to be excluded
in this regard) the parties to carry out acts or omissions (abstaining from) in order to
prevent the potential provisional measures from being stultified by a certain situation. It
is deemed appropriate to underline that in the originary version of the Rules of Court in
1921 the President of the Court was attributed a power to issue provisional measures in
urgent cases and when the Court was not sitting; however, in 1931 the Rules were
amended, excluding such a power which, to a certain extent, re-emerged — though in a
softer form — in the 1978 version of the Rules.

In such a request for pre-provisional measures — in consideration of the fact the request
was contemporary to the application — claimant essentially reinstated the measures
requested in the ordinary form, namely as far as the list, seals and delivery are
concerned; it only excluded the more time-consuming requests, such as _ those

concerning data and destruction of copies possibly at the disposal of third parties.

In the case concerning the obligation to prosecute or extradite between Belgium and
Senegal, claimant alleged that respondent was under an obligation to abide by the aut
dedere aut iudicare principle in relation to Hisséne Habré, former President of Chad
who at that time was living in Senegal. Belgium based its claims on the 1984 United
Nations convention against torture. On 19 February 2009, Belgium submitted a request
for provisional measures asking the Court “to indicate, pending a final judgment on the

merits, provisional measures requiring Senegal to take all the steps within its power to

°°8 Thid., para. 10.

130
Provisional Measures in International Investment Arbitration
Ph.D. Thesis — Federico Lenci

keep Mr. Habré under the control and surveillance of the judicial authorities of Senegal
so that the rules of international law with which Belgium requests compliancemay be
correctly applied”.**’ As a matter of fact, Belgium argued that, had Hisséne Habré left
the country, this would have caused prejudice to the rights claimed by Belgium in the

proceeding before the Court.

In the Pulp Mills case,°*° instituted by Argentina against Uruguay concerning the
construction of a factory — as a shared project of enterprise — along part of the river
Uruguay constituting the common boundary and the risk of environmental prejudices
connected thereto for the Argentinian population living on the other bank of the river,””’
two requests for provisional measures were requested, in different periods, firstly by
Argentina and subsequently by Uruguay.

Argentina requested the Court to safeguard its right to ensure that Uruguay complied
with its environmental obligations governing the construction of any enterprise along
the river Uruguay and to prevent Uruguay from causing damage to the river and to the
riparian population.”

Subsequent to a period during which Argentinian citizens blockaded an international
bridge over the river Uruguay in order to boycott commercial and tourist activities in
Uruguay, the latter requested the Court to indicate provisional measures whereby
Argentina would have had to remove the causes of the blockade and, in general, abstain

from any conduct or omission able to aggravate or extend the dispute.”*° At the same

In the LaGrand case,’”’ opposing Germany to the United States on the interpretation
and application of the obligation to notify a foreign detainee of its right to seek consular
assistance guaranteed by the Vienna Convention on consular relations, two German
nationals had been sentenced to the death penalty and — while one of them had already
been executed — the other one could still have his life saved by: 1) an order for
provisional measures to be issued by the Court and 2) compliance therewith by U.S.
authorities. Thus, in its request for provisional measures, Germany asked that, pending
final judgment on the merits, the Court indicate that “the United States should take all
measures at its disposal to ensure that Walter LaGrand is not executed pending the final
decision in these proceedings, and should inform the Court of all the measures which it

has taken in implementation of that Order”.””°

That the Government of Iran immediately clear the premises of the United States

Uruguay will accept it in good faith and will no longer have a need for judicial intervention, or for the
provisional measures requested herein. In such circumstances, Uruguay would be pleased to withdraw

Jurisdictional condition - prima facie jurisdiction / fumus bonae turisdictionis

Pursuing the analysis of the selected case law of the International court of justice
concerning provisional measures, the first logic step on which a decision thereupon has
to be construed is constituted as we have seen by an ictu oculi assessment on
jurisdiction to issue a judgment on the merits of the case.

In the recent Seizure and Detention of Documents case, it is noted that the Applicant
briefly referred to art. 36 of the ICJ Statute in relation to the existence of jurisdiction of
the Court, without any further comment thereupon.””*

The Court found that the jurisdictional condition has to be verified in a positive
perspective: if it appears that there is a basis on which its jurisdiction could be founded,
though not in a definitive manner, then the condition is met. Therefore, in the
terminolgy adopted here, the Court opted for a fumus bonae iurisdictionis condition,
though it is acknowledged that the expression prima facie jurisdiction has so far met
with success.

The Court referred to its order on provisional measures in the case Certain Activities

255

carried out by Nicaragua in the Border Area (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua)*~~ in which the

same positive perspective was upheld.**° The same approach can be found in the case

concerning the obligation to prosecute or extradite between Belgium and Senegal.”

Govemment of Iran should not by any executive or legislative act or judicial process require or attempt to
require the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, Limited, to dispose of the monies referred to in sub-paragraph
(d) above otherwise than in accordance with the terms of the Convention of 1933 or of any mesure to be
indicated by the Court. (f) The Imperial Govemment of Iran should ensure that no other steps of any kind
are taken capable of prejudicing the right of the Government of the United Kingdom to have a decision of
the Court in its favour on the merits of the case executed, should the Court render such a decision. (g) The
Imperial Government of Iran and the Government of the United Kingdom should ensure that no step of
any kind is taken capable of aggravating or extending the dispute submitted to the Court, and in
particular, the Imperial Government of Iran should abstain from all propaganda calculated to inflame
opinion in Iran against the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, Limited, and the United Kingdom”. The order is

In the Pulp Mills case instead, pronouncing on the request made by Argentina, the Court
— though expressing it in positive terms — had adopted a slightly different terminology, a
lower threshold for the jurisdictional condition to be met, i.e. that it has to appear that
such a basis might be established.’”*

In the LaGrand case a similar expression, once again expressing a lower threshold,
namely that it is necessary and sufficient that jurisdiction might be founded.’”’
However, it is submitted that, due to the peculiar characteristic of the case, where the
application for provisional measures was evaluated inaudita altera parte, thus without
the respect of the contradictoire, which is the cornerstone of the consensual system of
adjudicating organs between equal sovereign States, a higher threshold would have been
warranted. Undoubtedly, the particularly urgent situation led the Court to satisfy itself
of said jurisdictional basis. Might be founded is the expression also adopted in the
Hostages case.**° The same positive expression is adopted in the Nuclear Tests case.*°!
In the Anglo-Iranian Oil Co. case, on the contrary, the Court upheld a negative
perspective, finding that “whereas it cannot be accepted a priori that a claim based on
such a complaint [1.e., the exercise by the United Kingdom of the right of diplomatic
protection against denial of justice, A / N] falls completely outside the scope of
international jurisdiction”.”” It must be noted that the case at issue is the only one in the
case law of the International court of justice in which provisional measures were issued
and thereafter the Court found that it lacked jurisdiction to rule on the merits.”°°
Concluding on this point concerning the jurisdictional threshold, from the above
analysis of the tendencies of the Court it can be argued that the positive perspective
corresponds to the current status of the condition: being higher than the negative one, it

has the advantage of protecting the Court from the delicate situation of indicating

provisional measures which inevitably affect the addressee and thereafter finding that

these measures should have never been indicated, as in the Anglo-Iranian Oil Co. case.

Substantive conditions - urgency, necessity, risk of an irreparable harm and prima

facie bonum ius /fumus boni iuris

First of all, it has to be anticipated that, to a certain extent, the four substantive
conditions presented here are related. As a general remark, for example, the
requirements of urgency and necessity are intertwined, in the sense that one cannot exist
without the other: they are implied and justified by each other, since for a certain
would-be provisional measure to be urgent, it has to be necessary; for the same measure
to be necessary, it has to be urgent.

Another example is provided by the conditions of urgency and risk of irreparable harm:
if it is demonstrated that a certain situation constitutes a risk that a damage which
cannot be balanced with monetary compensation will happen, then the condition of
urgency is equally satisfied.”

In a nutshell, the risk of irreparable harm can be associated to the condition wherein the
status quo ante cannot be reverted subsequent to an act which the request for
provisional measures seeks to avoid.

A practical manifestation of this combination is given by the Seizure and Detention of
Documents case, both in the order and in the request made by the Government of
Timor-Leste. Indeed, the Court explained the meaning of the term “urgency” exactly by
making reference to the risk of irreparable prejudice: “the power of the Court to indicate
provisional measures will be exercised only if there is urgency, in the sense that there is
a real and imminent risk that irreparable prejudice will be caused to the rights in dispute
before the Court gives its final decision”.*® The same connection between urgency and

risk of irreparable harm in the very definition of the former had been advanced in the

°*4 Undoubtedly, the term “risk” in and of itself does not give a clear clue of the degree of intensity
required. The latter has to be assessed by a reference to the relevant case law.

°° Order, para. 32. In this respect as well, the Court confirmed its previous assessment on this point in the
case Certain Activities carried out by Nicaragua in the Border Area (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua) quoted
supra footnote 259, para. 64.

Passage through the Great Belt (Finland vy. Denmark) case’®, Pulp Mills case’®’ and in
the case concerning the obligation to prosecute or extradite between Belgium and
Senegal.”°*

It is noted, however, that this connection is not always present in the case law of the
ICJ: in this respect, an autonomous evaluation was carried out in the LaGrand,””
Hostages*”’ and Nuclear Tests*”' cases.

It is worth noting that in the Seizure and Detention of Documents case the Court
decided not to make any reference to the condition of necessity, arguably absorbed by
that of the risk of irreparable harm.*”

Concerning the fourth condition, namely the prima facie bonum ius / fumus boni iuris
binomial — where the former constitutes the negative perspective, while the latter
constitutes the positive and higher threshold — the case at issue is explanatory: the Court
found that this substantive condition is met if the Court is satisfied that the rights
asserted in the claim by the applicant “are at least plausible”.?” Therefore, the Court in
its most recent decision on provisional measures indicates a positive prespective for this
condition. The same approach was followed in the case concerning the obligation to
prosecute or extradite.?” Interestingly, in this case the Court went further in the
explanation of the term “plausibe”: “whereas the rights asserted by Belgium, being
grounded in a possible interpreation of the Convention against Torture, therefore appear
to be plausible”.””

Finally, as far as the effect of provisional measures is concerned, in the Seizure and

Detention of Documents case the Court reaffirms the binding effect — expressed for the

first time in its case law in the famous LaGrand case — of its orders on provisional

measures.*”°

C. Decision

In the Seizure and Detention of Documents case, the Court — acting under art. 75, para.
2, of the Rules of Court — exercised one of the manifestations of its motu proprio power,
namely that of granting issues other than those requested by the applicant: the milder
provisional measures ordered required Australia to keep custody under seal of the
seized documents and avoid interfering in the communications between the applicant
and its legal advisers in connection with the arbitration pending between them.”””

In the case concerning the obligation to prosecute or extradite, the Court decided not to
grant the measures requested due to the lack of urgency, as the Government of Senegal
had given formal assurances during the hearings that it would not allow Hisséne Habré
to leave its territory before the final decision of the ICJ.?”

In the Pulp Mills case, the Court denied the request due to the fact that the conditions
did not seem to have ben fulfilled. In particular, since Uruguay had taken certain
commitments and demonstrated a_ significantly cooperative attitute towards

Argentina,”

it is submitted that the Court deemed it appropriate to exercise its high
degree of judicial discretion in denying the measures requested.
In the LaGrand case, on the contrary, the Court acceded to the request of the German

Government,”*?

though with no substantial effect since the measures were not complied
with by the United States. The Court had unanimously voted in favour of the request;
however, this was probably due to the humanitarian reasons, as was the case for Judge
Shigeru Oda.**!

aimed at protecting the personnel and more broadly to abstain from any action likely to

further aggravate or extend the dispute and ensure that no action was committed by

Undoubtedly, provisional measures of a negative character (1.e., orders of abstention)
are the most frequently requested and granted, as the Nuclear Tests’* and the Anglo-

b) Before presenting the provisions concerning provisional measures and addressing
their contribution to the development of the institution of provisional measures in
public-international-law adjudication, it is deemed appropriate to briefly introduce the
kind of dispute settlement mechanism designed by the 1982 UNCLOS Convention,
namely its Part XV, articles 279 through 299.**°

To begin with, it has to be underlined that the provisions contained in the convention
come into play if the condition of the existence of a legal dispute is met. At the outset of
the creation of the first world court, the notion of legal dispute was highly

28

controversial.”*° In the leading view, expressed by the Permanent court of international

justice in the Mavrommatis Concessions case and still applicable today, it is

“A disagreement on a point of law or fact, a conflict of legal views or of interests between two

287
persons”.

*83 Order, para. 36: “The Governments of New Zealand and France should each of them ensure that no
action of any kind is taken which may aggravate or extend the dispute submitted to the Court or prejudice
the rights of the other Party in respect of the carrying out of whatever decision the Court may render in
the case; and, in particular, the French Government should avoid nuclear tests causing the deposit of
radio-active fall-out on the territory of New Zealand, the Cook Islands, Niue or the Tokelau Islands”.

284 Order, 8: “For these reasons, the Court, indicates [...] 1. That the Iranian Government and the United
Kingdom Government should ensure that no action is taken which might prejudice the rights of the other
Party in respect of the carrying out of any decision on the merits which the Court may subsequently
render; 2. That the Iranian Government and the United Kingdom Government should each ensure that no
action of any kind is taken which might aggravate or extend the dispute submitted to the Court; 3. That
the Iranian Government and the United Kingdom Government should each ensure that no measure of any
kind should be taken designed to hinder the carrying on of the industrial and commercial operations of the
Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, Limited, as they were carried on prior to May Ist, 1951”.

In addition thereto, a ratione materiae requirement shall be complied with for
jurisdiction to be established under the convention: the party to a dispute shall be either
a State party to the convention, or an entity other than States Parties in any case
expressly provided for in Part XI or in any case submitted pursuant to any other
agreement conferring jurisdiction on the Tribunal which is accepted by all the parties to
that case.

Furthermore, as a ratione materiae condition, according to article 287 (1) and 288 (1)
UNCLOS, the dispute shall concern the interpretation and/or application of the Law of
the Sea Convention.

Once these requirements are met, the parties to the convention may exercise their
discretion as to the choice of the adjudicating organ for the settlement of their dispute.
The UNCLOS architecture provides for the incidental proceeding at issue in its art. 290,

which reads as follows:

“Provisional measures

1. If a dispute has been duly submitted to a court or tribunal which considers that prima facie it
has jurisdiction under this Part or Part XI, section 5, the court or tribunal may prescribe any
provisional measures which it considers appropriate under the circumstances to preserve the
respective rights of the parties to the dispute or to prevent serious harm to the marine
environment, pending the final decision.

2. Provisional measures may be modified or revoked as soon as the circumstances justifying
them have changed or ceased to exist.

3. Provisional measures may be prescribed, modified or revoked under this article only at the
request of a party to the dispute and after the parties have been given an opportunity to be heard.
4. The court or tribunal shall forthwith give notice to the parties to the dispute, and to such other
States Parties as it considers appropriate, of the prescription, modification or revocation of
provisional measures.

5. Pending the constitution of an arbitral tribunal to which a dispute is being submitted under
this section, any court or tribunal agreed upon by the parties or, failing such agreement within

two weeks from the date of the request for provisional measures, the International Tribunal for

the Law of the Sea or, with respect to activities in the Area, the Seabed Disputes Chamber, may
prescribe, modify or revoke provisional measures in accordance with this article if it considers
that prima facie the tribunal which is to be constituted would have jurisdiction and that the
urgency of the situation so requires. Once constituted, the tribunal to which the dispute has been
submitted may modify, revoke or affirm those provisional measures, acting in conformity with
paragraphs | to 4.

6. The parties to the dispute shall comply promptly with any provisional measures prescribed

under this article”.

Several issues were discussed during the sessions of the Conference, particularly the
nature of provisional measures — whether they should be binding or merely
recommendatory — and the kind of authority which the adjudicating organ should be
entitled to exercise as far as the proprio motu power in its broader sense7*® is
concerned.”*”

The activities of the sessions at the Conference were influenced by the law and practice
of the International court of justice and in particular the interpretation and application of
art. 41 of the ICJ Statute, but finally the wording differed in some relevant respects
from that of the latter: the clearest example thereof is represented by the decision to
adopt the term prescribe, undoubtedly more indicative of a compulsory nature than the
term indicate as adopted in art. 41 of the ICJ Statute.

It is relevant to note a peculiar feature of “maritime provisional measures”: the latter
may not only be granted in order to preserve the rights of either party, but also to
prevent serious harm to the marine environment, therefore including a common concern
which broadens the positive impact of these measures.

Art. 290 UNCLOS provides for a dual procedure to decide on the prescription of
provisional measures. The first is constituded by the case in which a standing court or
tribunal agreed upon by the parties has jurisdiction to decide the case on the merits: it
may, aS a consequence, prescribe provisional measures (paragraph 1). The second

concerns the instance where the merits of the case shall be heard by an ad hoc arbitral

the ad hoc tribunal, either by the adjudicating organ agreed upon by the parties or, if
agreement in this sense is not reached, by the International tribunal for the law of the
sea (paragraph 5).

Furthermore, it has to be noted that the power to prescribe provisional measures under
art. 290 UNCLOS is discretionary, as is the case before the International court of
justice.

The most recent decision concerning provisional measures under the United Nations

convention on the law of the sea is the “Arctic Sunrise” case.””°

A. Facts

Background

On 4 October 2013, the Netherlands filed a claim instituting arbitral proceedings under
Annex VII to the UNCLOS.

The dispute concerns the boarding and detention of the vessel “Arctic Sunrise” in the
exclusive economic zone of the Russian Federation and the detention of the persons on

board the vessel by the authorities of the Russian Federation.

On 21 October 2013, the Government of the Netherlands filed with the ITLOS a request
for the prescription of provisional measures under art. 290, paragraph 5, pending the

constitution of an Annex VII arbitral tribunal.

It has to be noted that throughout the proceedings, the Russian Government decided not
to appear before the Tribunal. This procedural conduct, however, is unable to prevent a

prescription for provisional measures from being granted.””!

Object of the request

finally, to ensure that no further action is taken that may extend or aggravate the

its evaluation: “the Tribunal must satisfy itself that prima facie the Annex VII arbitral

the Convention invoked by the Netherlands appear to afford a basis on which the

jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal might be founded”.””

Substantive conditions - urgency, necessity, risk of an irreparable harm and prima

facie bonum ius /fumus boni iuris

After having read art. 290, para. 5, in conjunction with art. 290, para. 1, of the
Convention, the Tribunal referred to urgency as a condition which is determined by the
the period during which the Annex VII arbitral tribunal is not yet in a position to

“modify, revoke or affirm those provisional measures”.

C. Decision

The Tribunal, exercising a conjugation of its motu proprio power, found that it was
appropriate to prescribe a bond or other financial security as a provisional measure for
the release of the vessel and the persons detained.””’ As a consequence, it ordered that
the vessel and all the persons detained be released upon the posting of a bond in the
form of a bank guarantee, issued by a bank in Russia or having corresponding
arrangements with a Russian bank.’”®

under examination consists in the obligation to submit to the Tribunal a report on

compliance with any provisional measures prescribed.

The sources of international investment law are interrelated in a manner which is not
strictly hierarchical: however, for the purposes of the present study at this stage it is
sufficient to point to the fact that, except in the instances indicated herein, provisional
measures are seldom addressed in MITs, BITs, investor-State contracts and national
legislation. Still, the issue is very complex both theoretically and in practice, but a
reliable picture of the panorama can be drawn even without analysing each and every
tree or cloud therein.

Article 47 of the ICSID Convention allows an arbitral tribunal to recommend

provisional measures. It reads:

“Except as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal may, if 1t considers that the circumstances
so require, recommend any provisional measures which should be taken to preserve the

respective rights of either party”.

As already discussed in chapter 1, the exclusivity of an ICSID tribunal’s power to issue

Provisional Measures in International Investment Arbitration
Ph.D. Thesis — Federico Lenci

The opt-out provision allocates flexibility and generality to art. 47 of the ICSID
convention as a chapeau and permitting either to strenghten the force and effects of
these measures or to limit the latter, as is the case with the 2012 US Model BIT, art.
1134 of NAFTA Chapter 11 and art. 10.20.8 of the CAFTA Chapter 10.

Once again, the arbitral tribunal is given wide discretion as far as the decision to grant
or not provisional measures is concerned (“may”). Thus, the latter has to be construed
as a power, not as a duty; however, if a request for provisional measures is filed with the
arbitral tribunal, it has to rule thereupon, otherwise it would violate the principle of the
good administration of justice.

The requirement of the existence of certain circumstances — in this study, the
jurisdictional and substantive conditions — play an essential role in tempering the
relevant limitations on sovereignty likely to be produced by ensuring that provisional
measures are not issued lightly. This aspect is further developed by the ancillary
provision contained in art. 39 of the Arbitration rules, whereby the applicant is under an

obligation — if he wishes to have its request granted — to specify:

- the rights to be preserved (i.e. link between the right(s) in dispute and the object of the
request for provisional measures, referred to as the essential condition in the German

minority case handed down by the PCIJ);

- the measures requested (which however does not limit the power of the arbitral

tribunal to make use of its power to issue measures other than those requested);

- the circumstances that require such measures (1.e., the substantive conditions of

urgency and necessity).

Furthermore, these measures are atypical (“any”).

The soft wording of the text in relation to the force of the procedural decision is showed
by the combination of “recommend” and “should be taken”.

The fundamental conservatory purpose of these measures is highlighted by the adoption

of the term “preserve”.

This article, inspired by article 41 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice,
thus justifying the comparative approach which is adopted in this study, shows that the
parties can opt out of the power of the arbitral tribunal to grant interim relief, or can
restrict such power, as is the case for art. 1134 of the NAFTA Chapter 11,°™ art.

More details are found in ICSID Arbitration Rule 39 on Provisional Measures, which

reads:

“(1) At any time after the institution of the proceeding, a party may request that provisional
measures for the preservation of its rights be recommended by the Tribunal. The request shall
specify the rights to be preserved, the measures the recommendation of which is requested, and
the circumstances that require such measures.

(2) The Tribunal shall give priority to the consideration of a request made pursuant to paragraph
(1).

(3) The Tribunal may also recommend provisional measures on its own initiative or recommend
measures other than those specified in a request. It may at any time modify or revoke its
recommendations.

(4) The Tribunal shall only recommend provisional measures, or modify or revoke its
recommendations, after giving each party an opportunity of presenting its observations.

(5) If a party makes a request pursuant to paragraph (1) before the constitution of the Tribunal,
the Secretary-General shall, on the application of either party, fix time limits for the parties to
present observations on the request, so that the request and observations may be considered by
the Tribunal promptly upon its constitution.

(6) Nothing in this Rule shall prevent the parties, provided that they have so stipulated in the
agreement recording their consent, from requesting any judicial or other authority to order
provisional measures, prior to or after the institution of the proceeding, for the preservation of

their respective rights and interests”.

Provisional Measures in International Investment Arbitration
Ph.D. Thesis — Federico Lenci

- reference to para. 1 has already been made; however, it has to be added that
provisional measures can be requested — and, in case, granted — only after the institution
of the proceeding, thereby barring for the time being any form of pre-provisional
measure, pre-arbitral procedure or emergency-arbitrator provision like that provided for
by art. 29 of the 2012 ICC arbitration rules;

- para. 2: the request is given priority, coherently with the substantive condition of
urgency;

- para. 3: three conjugations of the ICSID arbitral tribunal’s proprio motu power;

- para. 4: the power to issue ex parte interim relief is excluded, due to compliance with
the contradictoire principle;

- para. 5: such an innovation serves the purpose of speeding up the evaluation and
decision on a request for provisional measures made when the arbitral tribunal is not
sitting yet. This provision resembles the practice of the PCIJ — after the 1931 revision of
the Rules of Court — and of the ICJ thereupon.

- para. 6: this interesting provision allows the application of the principle of concurrent
jurisdiction to rule on provisional measures, provided that the parties have opted out of
the exclusivity principle, which constitutes the general rule. With this amendment dated
2006, the procedure conducted under the ICSID convention becomes similar in this
respect to art. 46 of the ICSID AF rules and art. 26 of the UNCITRAL arbitration rules.
These brief remarks will be supplemented by the analysis conducted in Chapter 3 of this

inquiry dealing with the arbitral interpretation and application of these norms.

d) Cases which are not within the scope of the ICSID Convention can be administered
by the ICSID Centre under the Additional Facility (AF) Rules under certain conditions
set forth in Article 4 of those rules. Interim relief in AF proceedings is governed by
Article 46 of the AF Arbitration Rules, which contains a provision similar, but not

identical, to ICSID Arbitration Rule 39. Article 46 reads:

(1) Unless the arbitration agreement otherwise provides, either party may at any time
during the proceeding request that provisional measures for the preservation of its rights
be ordered by the Tribunal. The Tribunal shall give priority to the consideration of such

a request.

149

(2) The Tribunal may also recommend provisional measures on its own initiative or
recommend measures other than those specified in a request. It may at any time modify

or revoke its recommendations.

(3) The Tribunal shall order or recommend provisional measures, or any modification or
revocation thereof, only after giving each party an opportunity of presenting its

observations.

(4) The parties may apply to any competent judicial authority for interim or
conservatory measures. By doing so they shall not be held to infringe the agreement to

arbitrate or to affect the powers of the Tribunal.

It is worth noting that the force of these measures is expressed in clearer terms, in the
sense that they can be either binding or recommendatory according to the appropriate

discretion of the adjudicating body.*””

The tribunal’s power under the AF Arbitration Rules is also subject to potential
restrictions or extensions agreed by the parties, on an opt-out basis. Except for
differences that will specifically be addressed in the following discussion, the
application of interim relief under the AF Arbitration Rules follows that of the ICSID
Arbitration Rules. For example, in the case of Metalclad v. Mexico, governed by the AF
Rules and AF Arbitration Rules, the tribunal considered that the reasoning applicable
under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention was relevant in the context of these AF
proceedings and, more particularly, said that it was “no less applicable to the wording of

Article 1134 of the NAFTA”.

Art. 46(4) provides for the principle of concurrent jurisdiction to issue provisional

measures.

subject to mandatory rules of the law of the seat of arbitration, like in the first
representation (mono-localising) in Professor Gaillard’s theory.°”’ This process —
typical of international commercial arbitration in general and of investment arbitration
under the UNCITRAL rules — is due to the fact that, according to art. 1 of the AF
Arbitration Rules, the latter will not apply when “in conflict with a provision of the law

applicable to the arbitration from which the parties cannot derogate”’.

e) On January 1, 1994, the North American Free Trade Agreement between the United
States, Canada, and Mexico (NAFTA) entered into force.*'” It is divided into various
chapters, of which chapter 11 is devoted to investment provisions. It has been suggested
that NAFTA Chapter 11 represents a sort of aequilibrium between the 1994 US Model
BIT and the 2004 US Model BIT.*'' It is well known that between the 1994 version —
which may be called ultra-deregulative — and the 2004 one, many more common public

concerns were taken into account, also due to the debate concerning the Loewen case.

Article 1134 of the NAFTA®” contains a regulation of the power to decide upon

requests for provisional measures:

“A Tribunal may order an interim measure of protection to preserve the rights of a
disputing party, or to ensure that the Tribunal’s jurisdiction is made fully effective,
including an order to preserve evidence in the possession or control of a disputing party
or to protect the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. A Tribunal may not order attachment or enjoin
the application of the measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 1116
[claim by an investor of a party on its own behalf claiming inter alia for a breach of an
obligation under section A (investment)] or 1117 [claim by an investor of a party on

behalf of an enterprise claiming inter alia for a breach of an obligation under section A

(investment)]. For purposes of this paragraph, an order includes a recommendation’”.*’”

The provision therefore prohibits attachment orders and orders that enjoin the
application of the challenged measures. This limit is coherent with that of art. 1135,
attributing to the arbitral tribunal the authority to award only monetary damages.

NAFTA Chapter 11 arbitration can be conducted under:

- ICSID arbitration;?"*
- ICSID Additional Facility (AF) rules;*’°
- UNCITRAL Arbitration rules.*!°

Consequently, the authority of the arbitral tribunal applying NAFTA Chapter 11 rules in
the framework of one of the three arbitration rules is modified by the former,
particularly on the prohibition of attachment orders and orders that enjoin the

application of the challenged measures.

It can be noted at the outset that certain common features of this procedural mechanism
are reproduced herewith, namely the discretion to rule thereupon (“may”), the
power/right to issue such an order so as to preserve the status quo ante while the dispute
is pending before the adjudicating body expressed through the most frequently applied
measures.’'’ But the most significant innovation is represented by the last sentence in
the article: “for purposes of this paragraph, an order includes a recommendation”. This
means that the adjudicant has the power to issue either type of measures, 1.e. binding or
recommendatory, or even both in the same order: indeed, since express reference is
made to the inclusion of recommendations, it is implicitly assumed that an order may be

given binding force, when the tribunal deems it appropriate.

In addition, it is necessary to note that in cases brought under the ICSID AF and the

UNCITRAL rules a fundamental principle concerning provisional measures consists in
that of concurrent jurisdiction for the request and granting thereof, i.e. the applicant is
able to seek the latter from either the tribunal or from the domestic courts in the lex loci

f) The Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement
(CAFTA-DR) is a multilateral treaty entered into between the United States, the
Dominican Republic and five Central American States, namely Costa Rica, El Salvador,
Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua.”'” To a certain extent it constitutes a
manifestation of the pan-american sentiment already discussed above in the historical
section dedicated to the Corinto treaty and the project — and realisation — relating to a
Central american court of justice. It has takes part in the global phenomenon of regional
integration. It is a broad free trade framework, containing an investment chapter (ten).
Art. 10.20.8 of the CAFTA provides for the power to issue provisional measures,

reading as follows:

“A tribunal may order an interim measure of protection to preserve the rights of a disputing
party, or to ensure that the tribunal’s jurisdiction is made fully effective, including an order to
preserve evidence in the possession or control of a disputing party or to protect the tribunal’s
jurisdiction. A tribunal may not order attachment or enjoin the application of a measure alleged
to constitute a breach referred to in Article 10.16. For purposes of this paragraph, an order

includes a recommendation’.

As can be seen, it substantially reproduces the homologous provision contained in the
NAFTA,” thus it does not constitute an innovation in this respect, but rather an
element towards the assessment of a certain degree of consolidation of a consensus in

the region.

B.ILii. As far as sectoral treaties are concerned, it is worth mentioning the Energy
Charter Treaty (ECT). The ECT is a multilateral convention which entered into force in
April 1998.°7' It was created to encourage and protect investments and trade in the
energy field and to ensure reliable transit and efficient energy use. It is binding on over
fifty parties, including all the members of the European Union and many energy-rich
countries of Eastern Europe.*’? The ECT also provides for binding investor-State
arbitration as a dispute resolution mechanism to allow investors to enforce their rights
under the Treaty. The arbitrations are being administered by the Permanent Court of
Arbitration (PCA) in The Hague, under the United Nations Commission on
International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) Arbitration Rules. The provisions concerning
the dispute settkement mechanism are contained in Part V of the ECT (articles 26
through 28). Although provisional measures are not provided for in the ECT, the latter
constitutes a sort of chapeau, whereby such incidental proceedings are indirectly
included through the reference thereto in the applicable multilateral and bilateral
investment treaties. In chapter three, all the cases dealing with such a procedural feature
in the energy sector will be analysed and discussed, in order to ascertain whether the
specific sector at issue plays a role — and if so, to what extent — in the conditions for

their granting, in comparison with general investment law of procedure.

B.ILiii. A significant majority of investor-state arbitrations are initiated today on the
basis of an investment arbitration agreement (IAA), either a bilateral investment treaty
(BIT) or a multilateral investment treaty (MIT), such as the regional system provided
for by the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). These arbitrations are
most often governed by the Arbitration Rules of ICSID, the ICSID Additional Facility,

or UNCITRAL. Some BITs or MITs also refer to arbitration under the auspices of the
International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), the London Court of International
Arbitration (LCIA) or the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce (SCC).

However, there is no doubt that provisional measures are most frequently decided upon
in the context of proceedings governed by the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the ICSID
Additional Facility Arbitration Rules (both referred to as the ICSID system) and the
UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, because these are the arbitration rules most commonly
used in the context of investor-state disputes.

In this connection, bilateral investment treaties play a fundamental role in the creation
of a link between the chapeau, say, of the ICSID convention, whereby the Parties to the
multilateral treaty express their favour for that dispute settlement mechanism — however
without attributing jurisdiction to the Centre — and the specific investor-State
agreement, through the famous setting of arbitration without privity. ** Indeed,
jurisdiction of the ICSID Centre and competence of the arbitral tribunal established
thereby is triggered by the double gateway of art. 25 of the ICSID Convention and the
relevant bilateral investment treaty.

In general terms, bilateral investment treaties contain provisions regarding substantive-
law issues, given that — by refererring to a series of optional dispute settlement
mechanisms in the arbitration clause — the treaty is thus completed. However, it has to
be noted that this dualism is gradually being overcome by recent trends in BIT practice:
indeed, some States are beginning to include procedural provisions in their treaties,
short of limiting to a general reference to an arbitral mechanism. Such a treatification of
provisional measures — with all its consequences in terms of being able to become an instrument
of bargain between the parties and furthermore opening the way for a development which will
be introduced below — can be identified, for instance, in the United States-Peru Trade
Promotion Agreement signed on 12 April 2006, as well as in general article 28 of the U.S.
Model BIT dated 2004, both of which contain wording similar to the NAFTA provision referred
to above.” Art. 10.20.8 of the U.S. — Peru BIT reads as folows:

“A tribunal may order an interim measure of protection to preserve the rights of a disputing

party, or to ensure that the tribunal’s jurisdiction is made fully effective, including an order to

preserve evidence in the possession or control of a disputing party or to protect the tribunal’s
jurisdiction. A tribunal may not order attachment or enjoin the application of a measure alleged
to constitute a breach referred to in Article 10.16. For purposes of this paragraph, an order

includes a recommendation’.

It can be noted that the provision 1s identical to their homologous norms in the NAFTA

Chapter 11 and the CAFTA Chapter 10.

B.ILiv. As will be seen hereafter, the American continent is the cradle of the new
conception to insert specific provisions on interim measures of protection, thereby
derogating as leges speciales the general terms contained in the architecture of a
multilateral treaty such as, for instance, the ICSID convention. As already mentioned,
art. 47 of the latter expressly provides for a specific provision on an opt-out basis
(“except as the Parties otherwise agree”).

One further example of this phenomenon is given by the Canadian Model BIT.
Canadian investment policy is developing through a web of substantially identical BITs
which spread all over the world — as this is the very purpose of creating a model treaty —
under Canada’s Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Agreements (FIPAs).°”°

Art. 43 of the Canadian Model FIPA deals with interim measures of protection:

“A Tribunal may order an interim measure of protection to preserve the rights of a disputing
party, or to ensure that the Tribunal’s jurisdiction is made fully effective, including an order to
preserve evidence in possession or control of a disputing party or to protect the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction. A Tribunal may not order attachment or enjoin the application of the measure
alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 22 (Claim by an Investor of a Party on its
Own Behalf) or 23 (Claim by an Investor of a Party on Behalf of an Enterprise). For purposes of

this paragraph, an order includes a recommendation”.

Art. 43 confirms that a tribunal may not enjoin the application of a measure over which
a dispute has arisen between the parties. Considering the identity of article 43 with the
homologous provisions in the NAFTA, CAFTA and art. (8) of the 2004 U.S. Model

BIT, the reader is referred to the appropriate sections of this inquiry.

It is worth noting, however, that — contrary to what has been asserted by Lévesque and

327 _ the last sentence which includes a

Newcombe commenting on this article
recommendation within the range of measures which can be issued does not seem to
simply “recognize” the existence of art. 47 of the ICSID convention (containing the
expression “recommend”, whose evolutionary interpretation is disputed in the
literature), but rather to specify that where the treaty is applicable both orders and
recommendations can be granted.

Another Model Investment treaty — though it is not bilateral but trilateral — is constituted
by NAFTA Chapter 11, with its art. 1134 on interim measures of protection.°*

Finally, the 2012 US Model BIT,” constituting to a certain extent the consolidation of
the progress towards a more balanced approach to foreign direct investments,**” is

relevant for this inquiry due to its art. 28(8), which reads as follows:

“A tribunal may order an interim measure of protection to preserve the rights of a disputing
party, or to ensure that the tribunal’s jurisdiction is made fully effective, including an order to
preserve evidence in the possession or control of a disputing partyor to protect the tribunal’s
jurisdiction. A tribunal may not order attachment or enjoin the application of a measure alleged
to constitute a breach referred to in Article 24. For purposes of this paragraph, an order includes

: 331
a recommendation’.

The provision at issue, identical to the NAFTA Chapter 11 and the CAFTA Chapter 10
homologous norms on provisional measures, is nothing but another evidence of the

political power exerted by the United States when negotiating, inter alia, these

international investments agreements. Due to said homogeneity, the reader is referred to

the relevant sections of this inquiry.

B.IL.v. On the issue concerning treatification / contractualisation, many facets can be
put under scrutiny, as it constitutes a general phenomenon in international investment
law and arbitration. However, though some common features will not be neglected here,
it is deemed more appropriate to focus on their impact on provisional measures.

°°? that in the last twenty years the tendency to include procedural

It has been seen above
mechanisms and, in particular, norms on provisional measures in bilateral as well as
multilateral treaties (derogating from the broader chapeau of the ICSID convention, art.
47 and art. 39 of the Arbitration rules) has started to increase in a certain area of the
world. Such an area has contributed significantly to the evolution and consolidation of
the field.

One may call such a tendency “treatification” of these measures, which acquire a
significant bargaining power when the relevant treaty text is being discussed: generally
speaking, capital-exporting countries shall tend to be more interested in the inclusion of
extensive, binding and effective provisional measures, due to the fact that — with the
significant exception of the cautio iudicatum solvi measure — the majority of provisional
measures are requested by the claimant (1.e., the foreign private investor) against the
respondent, i.e. the Sovereign; on the contrary, capital-importing countries — 1.e., those
which risk to become respondents in one of the disputes possibly arising out of the
treaty at issue, have an interest in restricting its scope and effects.

The same opposition — negotiation is likely to manifest itself when a contract is being
entered into between a private investor of a country which has ratified a BIT with its
would-be host State and that host State: if provisional measures have not been
addressed, treatified, in the BIT, there is still room for bargaining between the parties to
an investor-State contract whose potential jurisdiction is already covered by the relevant
BIT.

A question then arises: is contractualisation envisageable as far as provisional measures

are concerned? The mere fact that so far practice have shown that parties to an

158
Provisional Measures in International Investment Arbitration
Ph.D. Thesis — Federico Lenci

investment contract generally do not address provisional measures specifically,
preferring to refer to institutional rules or to those provided for by UNCITRAL, does
not seem — at this provisional stage — to exclude theoretically such a development
towards contractualisation. This theme will be further addressed in the following

chapter.

2)

B.IL.vi. Undoubtedly, institutional arbitration — 1.e. international arbitration which is
administered and conducted under the auspices of an arbitral centre, following the rules
of procedure established thereby — constitutes an unconventional source in the
framework of public international law. The reason for that lies in the nature and practice
of these centres, which were created in order to meet the needs of international
commercial operators in a rapidly more interconnected business world, namely the

following:

- to seek an impartial dispute settlkement mechanism, providing them with more
guarantees than national courts potentially biased in favour of the company established
in that national market;

- taking advantage of the power to determine the constitution of the adjudicating organ,
to benefit from the specific knowledge of arbitrators of their choice;

- to have their disputes settled within a reasonable time;

- to avoid the public awareness — also known under the latin expression strepitus fori —
of the existence of the dispute and the negative consequences thereof: in one word,
confidentiality;

- as a consequence, to reduce the costs connected to an uncertain legal situation;

- considering the successful system created, inter alia, by the New York convention on

judgments. Thus, this reason is closely related to the second one in the complete process

of the admistration of justice.**°

Therefore, international arbitration between two or more private parties is classified
under the name of international commercial arbitration. This category shall be kept
distinct from international investment arbitration which, as it has been demonstrated, is
inscribed within the realm of public international law, whereas the former derives its
nature from the area of private international law, with all the theoretical and practical
consequences connected thereto.

Once again, short of desiring to justify and erect a wall of separation between public
international law and private international law, it is nonetheless essential to distinguish
the two areas due to the peculiarities of their essence and features. In relation to this
inquiry, it is submitted that the comparative analysis that is conducted here as part of the
two-fold differentiated approach shall not extend to the investigation on provisional
measures in international commercial arbitration.”

At this point, given that institutional arbitration mainly serves the purpose of
adjudicating disputes between private parties, that as a consequence it constitutes part of
private international law and consequently that provisional measures adopted within this
framework cannot be considered for comparative purposes with public-international-

law settings, the question may arise as to why are they nonetheless comprised in this

inquiry.

°°? These reasons — which are listed herewith in the comparison international arbitrators / national courts —

are constitute common features of arbitration fout court, both international and national. For a concise and
clear example of this latter adoption see FUMAGALLI, Le Emergency Arbitration Rules ne/ nuovo
Regolamento di Arbitrato della Camera di Commercio Internazionale, Rivista dell’arbitrato, Vol. 23, n.
3, 2013, 654: “Sotto il profilo della << critica >> del meccanismo arbitrale, infine, questo viene misurato,
soprattutto in termini di efficacia, sulla scala di raffronto offerta dalla giurisdizione ordinaria. Infatti,
proprio dal confronto con l’ordinario strumento di tutela dei diritti si giunge a riconoscere le peculiari
caratteristiche che, normalmente, sono ricollegate alla messa in opera dell’arbitrato: neutralita,
specializzazione, confidenzialita, flessibilita, rapidita”.

4 For an evaluation of the issue of provisional measures in international commercial arbitration I
particularly benefited from the following studies: CARLEVARIS, La tutela cautelare nell’arbitrato
internazionale, Padova, 2006; YESILIRMAK, Provisional Measures in International Commercial
Arbitration, Leiden, 2005. However, their results, as well as the relevant case law, indicate that it does not
seem to be appropriate to compare these two areas of international arbitration, given the peculiarities of
the investment framework and the quality of the Sovereign, with all the implications which are further
described here.

160
Provisional Measures in International Investment Arbitration
Ph.D. Thesis — Federico Lenci

The reason lies in the adverb mainly, as the most successful institutions for administered
international commercial arbitration are gradually becoming attractive fora also for
State-private party arbitration: in this respect, distinguishing between arbitration based
on commercial State contracts (which are outside the scope of the present inquiry for
the reasons above stated) and investment treaty arbitration, it is noted that the latter shall
be part of a comparative analysis as it is inscribed in public international law.

This group of institutional arbitrations finds its basis in arbitration clauses contained in
a bilateral investment treaty, whereby the latter are presented as options. Such a
phenomenon, by no means a novel one, is still minoritary in practice and to my
knowledge cases of application of provisional measures in relation thereto have not
come to surface yet; however, since the theoretical basis has been founded, it is deemed
appropriate to take it into consideration, at least on the interpretation of the normative
level.

Such an endeavour is here limited to the three main organs which are representative of
this trend, in the idea that under these auspices arbitral case law will likely manifest
itself in due course. Finally, it is submitted that the following arbitration rules on
provisional mesures, designed for international commercial disputes, may be subject to
interpretation through slightly more deferential lenses when a mixed dispute is at play,
at the same time abiding by a genuine principle of equality of the parties. This is made
possible — as will be indicated — by the broad and flexible terms adopted.

Concluding on this point, it is deemed appropriate to argue that these sets of
institutional arbitration may be considered as sources for the interpretation and
application of provisional measures in public international law, insofar as the latter is

limited to a deferential version in a comparative perspective.

a) The first arbitration rules under investigation in this respect are those of the
International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) International Court of Arbitration.**°

Art. 28 of the 2012 ICC arbitration rules**° provides that

“1. Unless the parties have otherwise agreed, as soon as the file has been transmitted to it, the
arbitral tribunal may, at the request of a party, order any interim or conservatory measure it
deems appropriate.

The arbitral tribunal may make the granting of any such measure subject to appropriate security
being furnished by the requesting party. Any such measure shall take the form of an order,
giving reasons, or of an award, as the arbitral tribunal considers appropriate.

2. Before the file is transmitted to the arbitral tribunal, and in appropriate circumstances even
thereafter, the parties may apply to any competent judicial authority for interim or conservatory
measures. The application of a party to a judicial authority for such measures or for the
implementation of any such measures ordered by an arbitral tribunal shall not be deemed to be
an infringement or a waiver of the arbitration agreement and shall not affect the relevant powers
reserved to the arbitral tribunal.

Any such application and any measures taken by the judicial authority must be notified without

delay to the Secretariat. The Secretariat shall inform the arbitral tribunal thereof”.

This provision substantially reproduces the terms of its antecedent, namely art. 23 of the
rules. As it has already been underlined, no case law concerning the interpretation and
application of this article has so far emerged in investor-State arbitration.**’

The ICC framework adopts, as far as provisional measures are concerned, the principle
of concurrent jurisdiction to issue these measures between the arbitral tribunal and the
competent national court. In brief, this means that parties may choose to request interim

protection either before the arbitral tribunal — if the /ex loci arbitri allows the latter to

rule thereupon — or before the competent State court, namely that of the place in which
the measure shall be enforced or that of the place which would be competent to decide
the main claim in the absence of the arbitration agreement.

Various reasons may warrant a request from the latter, in particular when the arbitral
tribunal is not yet constituted and the would-be applicant does not wish to have recourse
to the pre-arbitral referee procedure, or in any other case in which the imperium of the
State court seems to guarantee a better result in terms of effectiveness.

Concurrent jurisdiction is a common feature — as will be discussed more in detail
hereafter — in institutional arbitration: ICC, LCIA, SCC and UNCITRAL all have such
an element in common. ICSID arbitration — with its exclusive-jurisdiction principle, in
combination with art. 26 of the convention, are an exception thereto, constituting — in
this as in other respects — a clearly distinctive factor.

Turing back to ICC arbitration and the concurrent-jurisdiction principle and
application, it has to be underlined that the latter has significant implications in
connection with the way they are handled by the arbitral tribunal: indeed, it has to
consider if it has the power to issue such measures. In this respect, it firstly assesses
whether the agreement of the parties provides for this power to be exercised.

However, generally that agreement attributing or denying such power is silent
thereupon.*** If this is the case, it takes into consideration the applicable ICC arbitration
rules. According, to art. 24, paragraph 1 of the rules, the arbitral tribunal is attributed
such power; however, in order to finally determine if it has the power in the specific
case, the arbitral tribunal has also to consider the /ex loci arbitri, which may deny itt.
Indeed, under some national legislations — namely, Argentina, China, Greece, Italy and
Québec — the power to issue provisional and conservatory measures is reserved to
national courts. At this point, the arbitral tribunal is confronted with a dilemma, which
has been clearly described and discussed by Prof. Emmanuel Gaillard in the famous
course that he delivered at the Hague Academy of International law in 2007, when he

referred to three representations of international arbitration, of which the mono-

localising is on one side, the pluri-localising and the arbitral order on the other side in
this respect.°°’

Para. 1 provides for the the possibility to opt out of provisional measures in the
agreement of the parties and contains a general reference to atypicalness of the
measures (“any”). The second part of the paragraph gives discretion to the arbitral
tribunal to require a security in order to cover the measure(s) granted.

Para. 2 contains the principle of concurrent jurisdiction, clearly distinguishing between
the period in which the file has not yet been transmitted to the arbitral tribunal (when
provisional measures can be more easily requested from the competent State court) and
the subsequent period, wherein “appropriate circumstances” have to call for such a
request.

It has to be noted that the 2012 ICC Arbitration Rules introduce a new instrument
relating to provisional measures, when the arbitral tribunal has not yet been constituted
and the circumstances require that provisional measures be decided upon on an urgent
basis, namely the Emergency Arbitrator Rules. Art. 29 sets the characteristics of such a
proceeding, whereby the ICC followed the general trend towards a more effective
protection of the rights of the parties, a need which was strongly felt by the international
business community. Its para. 5 provides that such a procedure is applicable only in
regard to parties signatory, or successors thereto, of the arbitration agreement indicating
that ICC arbitration rules shall govern the procedure. Professor Fumagalli explained that
such a limitation produces the effect of excluding the applicability of such a procedure
in investment treaty arbitration, precisely due to the lack of direct derivation of the

power of the arbitral tribunal from the contractual agreement between the parties.**”

For this reason, the Emergency Arbitrator Rules fall outside of the scope of the present

inquiry.

b) The LCIA is the oldest known continuously established international arbitration
institution in the world.**' It was created in 1892 as the “London Chamber of
Arbitration” in order to solve business disputes between commercial operators desiring
to continue their transactions, as in the traditional view of arbitration which no more
constitutes an automatic feature in international arbitration today. In the words of

Reynolds,

“Arbitration has to be perceived in the light of an amicable means of resolving the dispute. It is
not to be treated in the strict adversarial battle sense which may have its place in the common
law courts where the judges have considerable statutory and common law powers, whereas in
arbitrations, to an extent, the arbitrator is at the mercy of the parties [...]. Success, therefore, for
arbitration lies in the notion that the practical mechanism which neutralises the adversarial
nature or tendency towards an adversarial entrenchment is the best means by which real

. . “4° 342
arbitration can be utilised”.

The LCIA framework differs in many respects from the International Court of
Arbitration of the ICC. In particular, the LCIA Arbitration Court does not scrutinize
draft awards before they are served with the parties thereto. Indeed, such a scrutiny,
together with the Terms of Reference provided for by the ICC rules constitutes a
peculiar feature of the ICC’s procedure.

The 1998 LCIA rules substituted those of 1985. The reason for such a general
amendment was due to the entry into force of the 1996 English Arbitration Act.”

As a general remark, it has to be noted that parties, in practice, rarely determine in

express terms the procedural rules they wish to have for regulating their potential

dispute: normally, they refer to the institutional rules of an arbitral centre. Considering

the above, the drafters of rules for arbitral procedure may follow one of two paths:
either they set a procedural rule — as, in our topic, concerning provisional measures —
through a broad reference whose content will be conjugated and developed by the
arbitrators in their practice (as is the case, for example, in the ICC), or instead set out a
prescriptive list of types of measures and steps to be observed in order to give a
guidance — and limitation — to the arbitral tribunal. In the absence of party agreement to
the contrary, these provisions will be followed by the adjudicating organ. This second

approach is followed by the LCIA rules,*”* namely in article 25, which reads as follows:

“25.1 The Arbitral Tribunal shall have the power, unless otherwise agreed by the parties in
writing, on the application of any party:

(a) to order any respondent party to a claim or counterclaim to provide security for all or part of
the amount in dispute, by way of deposit or bank guarantee or in any other manner and upon
such terms as the Arbitral Tribunal considers appropriate. Such terms may include the provision
by the claiming or counterclaiming party of a cross-indemnity, itself secured in such manner as
the Arbitral Tribunal considers appropriate, for any costs or losses incurred by such respondent
in providing security. The amount of any costs and losses payable under such cross-indemnity
may be determined by the Arbitral Tribunal in one or more awards;

(b) to order the preservation, storage, sale or other disposal of any property or thing under the
control of any party and relating to the subject matter of the arbitration; and

(c) to order on a provisional basis, subject to final determination in an award, any relief which
the Arbitral Tribunal would have power to grant in an award, including a provisional order for
the payment of money or the disposition of property as between any parties.

25.2 The Arbitral Tribunal shall have the power, upon the application of a party, to order any
claiming or counterclaiming party to provide security for the legal or other costs of any other
party by way of deposit or bank guarantee or in any other manner and upon such terms as the
Arbitral Tribunal considers appropriate. Such terms may include the provision by that other
party of a cross-indemnity, itself secured in such manner as the Arbitral Tribunal considers
appropriate, for any costs and losses incurred by such claimant or counterclaimant in providing
security. The amount of any costs and losses payable under such cross-indemnity may be

determined by the Arbitral Tribunal in one or more awards. In the event that a claiming or

*“ The 2010 UNCITRAL rules follow — as far as ad hoc arbitration is concerned — a similar approach,
influenced therein by the 2006 amendments to the UNCITRAL Model Law.

166

Ph.D. Thesis — Federico Lenci

counterclaiming party does not comply with any order to provide security, the Arbitral Tribunal
may stay that party's claims or counterclaims or dismiss them in an award.

25.3 The power of the Arbitral Tribunal under Article 25.1 shall not prejudice howsoever any
party's right to apply to any state court or other judicial authority for interim or conservatory
measures before the formation of the Arbitral Tribunal and, in exceptional cases, thereafter. Any
application and any order for such measures after the formation of the Arbitral Tribunal shall be
promptly communicated by the applicant to the Arbitral Tribunal and all other parties. However,
by agreeing to arbitration under these Rules, the parties shall be taken to have agreed not to
apply to any state court or other judicial authority for any order for security for its legal or other

costs available from the Arbitral Tribunal under Article 25.2”.°”

As anticipated, it consists of a lenghty list of specific types of measures, steps and
requirements to be observed. The power of the arbitral tribunal to issue interim and
conservatory measures can be excluded; however, failing an agreement in this respect,
they will be part of the prerogatives thereof. Undoubtedly, the exercise of such power
will depend on the arbitration provisions contained in the /ex loci arbitri.

The expression “on the application of any party” in paras. 1 and 2 seems to bar proprio
motu measures.

Lett. a) expressly provides for security for costs (cautio iudicatum solvi), \ett. b) for
orders aimed at preserving evidence and / or property related to the rights in dispute,
lett. c) opens to atypical provisional measures and to order on a provisional basis,
subject to final determination in an award, any relief which the Arbitral Tribunal would
have power to grant in an award, adopting the same terms as section 39 of the 1996
English Arbitration Act.
The relationship between art. 25 LCIA arbitration rules and section 39 of the 1996

346

English Arbitration Act lies in the fact that the latter confers to an arbitral tribunal
having its seat in England the power to order these measures only if the parties have so
agreed (opt-in), whereas through reference to the LCIA rules the parties indirectly
manifest their agreement to opt-in, stating that such power is attributed except the

parties agree otherwise (opt-out).

Ph.D. Thesis — Federico Lenci

Art. 25, para. 3, expresses the principle of concurrent jurisdiction between the arbitral
tribunal and State courts.

Concerning the enforceability of arbitral interim and conservatory measures, as
distinguished from the more effective mechanism afforded by State courts which have
imperium, this is limited to the drawing of adverse inferences.**”

It has to be underlined that — as is the case for the ICC rules — the LCIA rules do not set
any requirement for the issuance of provisional measures, leaving broad discretion upon
the arbitral tribunal. Guidelines can be derived from art. 17 of the UNCITRAL Model
Law or rather, as the thesis defended here, through reference (relating to investment
treaty arbitration) to the trends in the overall jurisprudence in public-international-law
adjudication, in particular, though of course not exclusively, to ICSID arbitration. The
latter will be analysed in detail in the following chapter, which draws on the conditions,

purposes and atypical measures issued under those auspices.

c) The 2010 Stockholm Chamber of Commerce Arbitration rules*”* contain a provision

on interim measures in art. 32, which reads as follows:

“(1) The Arbitral Tribunal may, at the request of a party, grant any interim measures it deems
appropriate.

(2) The Arbitral Tribunal may order the party requesting an interim measure to provide
appropriate security in connection with the measure.

(3) An interim measure shall take the form of an order or an award.

(4) Provisions with respect to interim measures requested before arbitration has been
commenced or a case has been referred to an Arbitral Tribunal are set out in Appendix II.

(5) A request for interim measures made by a party to a judicial authority is not incompatible

with the arbitration agreement or with these Rules”.

As in the LCIA rules, a proprio motu power seems to be excluded by para. 1 (“at the
request of a party”). As in art. 28 of the 2012 ICC rules, the drafters of the SCC rules in
para. 1 decided to provide for atypicalness in its broadest sense, i.e. in the second option

referred to above.

Ph.D. Thesis — Federico Lenci

Para. 2 refers to the power to order a cautio iudicatum solvi to be deposited by the
applicant, with the purpose of covering the expenses related to interim measures which
later may manifestly appear as not appropriate. The arbitral tribunal has wide discretion
to order any interim measure and — /e cas écheant — the appropriate security.

As to the force of the measures issued by the arbitral tribunal, the term “order” in para.
3 manifestly indicates their binding nature.

Finally, para. 5 concludes with the principle of concurrent jurisdiction between the
arbitral tribunal and State courts of the place where the measures sought shall be

enforced or of the place where the arbitral tribunal has its seat.

B.ILvii. The original 1976 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules were revised in 2010,
following the 2006 revision of the 1985 UNCITRAL Model Law.*”’ The 2006 revision
replaced former Article 17 on interim measures with a new Chapter IV bis, establishing

a comprehensive legal regime on interim measures in support of arbitration.

The UNCITRAL Working Group on Arbitration and Conciliation had drafted a revised
version of the interim measures provision of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, article
26.6., which represents a significant departure from the original UNCITRAL Rules. The
2010 rules are applicable to arbitration agreements concluded after the date of adoption
of the revised version of the Rules; whereas the 1976 Arbitration Rules continue to
apply to pending cases and, if the parties so wish, to cases initiated after the entry into
force of the new Rules. The two sets of Rules are presented here since they are
applicable to investor-State proceedings as long as no new set of rules specifically
designed for this type of arbitration is elaborated. Article 26 of the 1976 UNCITRAL

Arbitration Rules, entitled “Interim Measures of Protection’, reads:

“1. At the request of either party, the arbitral tribunal may take any interim measures it deems

The Working Group considered that the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules were to be harmonized with

the corresponding provisions of the Model Law only where appropriate and not as a matter of course
(Report of Working Group II (Arbitration and Conciliation) on the work of its 45th Session, September
11-15, 2006, Vienna, A/CN.9/614, para. 104). Although it was gen- erally of the view that a revision of
Article 26 was needed to take into account the new provi- sions of the Model Law, the view was also
expressed that the controversial provisions of Chapter [V should not be included in the Arbitration Rules,
in order not to endanger their acceptability (ibid.). All the Working Group’s documents are available at
http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/commission/working_groups/2 Arbitration.html.

169
Provisional Measures in International Investment Arbitration
Ph.D. Thesis — Federico Lenci

necessary in respect of the subject-matter of the dispute, including measures for the
conservation of the goods forming the subject-matter in dispute, such as ordering their deposit

with a third person or the sale of perishable goods.

2. Such interim measures may be established in the form of an interim award. The arbitral

tribunal shall be entitled to require security for the costs of such measures.

3. A request for interim measures addressed by any party to a judicial authority shall not be

deemed incompatible with the agreement to arbitrate, or as a waiver of that agreement”.

While the 1976 version of Article 26 does not mention it, parties to UNCITRAL
proceedings can limit the scope of the tribunal’s power if they so wish. Article 26 was
adopted by the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal without modification. Hence, the
jurisprudence of the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal provides a significant contribution when
analysing the power of an arbitral tribunal to grant interim relief under the 1976

UNCITRAL Rules and provides good guidance in the application of the Rules.
Article 26 of the 2010 UNCITRAL Arbitration rules reads as follows:

“1. The arbitral tribunal may, at the request of a party, grant interim measures.

2. An interim measure is any temporary measure by which, at any time prior to the issuance of
the award by which the dispute is finally decided, the arbitral tribunal orders a party, for

example and without limitation, to:
(a) Maintain or restore the status quo pending determination of the dispute;

(b) Take action that would prevent, or refrain from taking action that is likely to cause, (1)

current or imminent harm or (11) prejudice to the arbitral process itself;

(c) Provide a means of preserving assets out of which a subsequent award may be satisfied;

or
(d) Preserve evidence that may be relevant and material to the resolution of the dispute.

3. The party requesting an interim measure under paragraphs 2 (a) to (c) shall satisfy the arbitral

tribunal that:

170
Provisional Measures in International Investment Arbitration
Ph.D. Thesis — Federico Lenci

(a) Harm not adequately reparable by an award of damages is likely to result if the measure is
not ordered, and such harm substantially outweighs the harm that is likely to result to the party

against whom the measure is directed if the measure is granted; and

(b) There is a reasonable possibility that the requesting party will succeed on the merits of the
claim. The determination on this possibility shall not affect the discretion of the arbitral tribunal

in making any subsequent determination.

4. With regard to a request for an interim measure under paragraph 2 (d), the requirements in

paragraphs 3 (a) and (b) shall apply only to the extent the arbitral tribunal considers appropriate.

5. The arbitral tribunal may modify, suspend or terminate an interim measure it has granted,
upon application of any party or, in exceptional circumstances and upon prior notice to the

parties, on the arbitral tribunal’s own initiative.

6. The arbitral tribunal may require the party requesting an interim measure to provide

appropriate security in connection with the measure.

7. The arbitral tribunal may require any party promptly to disclose any material change in the

circumstances on the basis of which the interim measure was requested or granted.

8. The party requesting an interim measure may be liable for any costs and damages caused by
the measure to any party if the arbitral tribunal later determines that, in the circumstances then
prevailing, the measure should not have been granted. The arbitral tribunal may award such

costs and damages at any point during the proceedings.

9. A request for interim measures addressed by any party to a judicial authority shall not be

deemed incompatible with the agreement to arbitrate, or as a waiver of that agreement.”.°”’

As in the LCIA and SCC Arbitration rules, a proprio motu power of the arbitral tribunal
to grant interim mesures is excluded by the expression “at the request of a party”

contained in para. 1. Furthermore, such a power is discretional (“may”).

Para. 2 indicates the atypicalness of such measures (“for example and without

limitation”, [emphasis added, A / NJ).

171
Provisional Measures in International Investment Arbitration
Ph.D. Thesis — Federico Lenci

In relation to the majority of the types of measures contained in the list, para. 3 provides

for the substantive’>’ conditions for the granting thereof, namely:
- risk of irreparable harm, with the addition of the balancing condition (proportionality);

- reasonable possibility of success on the merits, i.e. a high threshold of fumus boni

iuris, aS compared with the “plausible” test in ICJ jurisprudence.

A little, timid indication of proprio motu measures is provided for in para. 5 concerning
the modification, suspension and termination of the measures already granted — though
in exceptional circumstances — and in this sense it is submitted that the arbitral tribunal
cannot exercise such a power when it deems it “appropriate”, but rather when it deems
it “necessary”, due to the need to combine such choice with the exceptional
circumstance (which is exceptional insofar as it makes it necessary for the organ to

change the measures already granted).

The authority of a tribunal to order interim relief under the UNCITRAL Rules is subject
to any mandatory rules of the national law applicable to the arbitration. Thus, the power
of a tribunal to grant interim relief depends on the /ex arbitri which as we have seen in

few jurisdictions is reserved to State courts.

Like art. 32(2) of the SCC rules, para. 6 provides for the power to require that a cautio

iudicatum solvi be borne by the applicant in order to cover the interim measure granted.

Para. 8 provides for the obligation incumbent upon both parties to cooperate and

exchange information regarding the measure(s) granted for a potential change thereof.

Finally, para. 9 specifies the principle of concurrent jurisdiction to issue interim

measures.

°°! Apparently, the jurisdictional condition of prima facie jurisdiction is not expressed in the text.

Introduction. The function of an introduction is, generally, to present the content of a
given analysis. These lines are not an exception thereto: in brief, this chapter analyses
the core of the whole doctoral thesis, namely the nature, practice and impact of
provisional measures on international investment arbitration.

Before explaining the process, the additional preliminary exercise required here is to
justify what may appear a rather irritual choice: indeed, while section one is devoted to
two specific elements of said procedural instrument, the following section draws on its
general features, thus creating a dynamic from specific to general. The reason behind
this choice is to address at the outset legal force and jurisdiction to rule thereupon for
their capacity to shed light on conditions, purposes and atypicalness: one may better
understand the practical relevance of the latter after focusing on the value of the former.
Section three addresses special situations related to provisional measures, meaning that
in certain cases they are external to arbitration, as for instance anti-arbitration
injunctions and court-ordered provisional measures entailing discriminatory treatment.

Section four attempts at introducing future developments of this procedural instrument.
Provisional Measures in International Investment Arbitration
Ph.D. Thesis — Federico Lenci

The absence — to date — of monographic studies on the topic under examination, coupled
with the fact that it constitutes a ‘moving target’, makes the whole process more
complex and stimulating.

In recent years we have witnessed a dramatic increase in investor-State claims under a
plethora of international, national and transnational instruments: quite unsurprisingly,
the number of requests for provisional measures has increased at an even higher rate,
due to more lenghty and costly proceedings.’

All such a huge, variable and — at times — inconsistent set of data had to be organised in
order to attempt at drawing hypothetical lines of development and consolidation. It has
to be said at the outset that these data have not been drawn into statistics, due to the
doubtfulness and arbitraryness to which such an exercise would have risked to lead:
indeed, very rare are the cases in which arbitral tribunals acceded to 100% of the
requesting party’s claim (and equally rare are the opposite, i.e. 0%), since, in the
striking majority of cases, arbitral tribunals accepted some requests while they rejected
other ones and/or issued provisional measures different from those requested, but in
many cases similar, ... and so forth.

Then, a question arises: if the requesting party files a request containing four different
points and the arbitral tribunal grants only one out of four, should this request be
considered as accepted? If yes, why? Or not? Again, if not, why? Should it be attributed
0,25 points or some other witchcraft? Can the value of a provisional measure be
quantified? I have to disclose my deepest reservations about certain lines of research
consisting in testing international investment arbitration awards and in deriving data
from quantitative studies, such as the ratio of cases won/lost in relation to the total of
cases filed (for example, in order to see whether ICSID arbitration is more favourable to
host States or investors) and more refined studies which in any manner will fail to grasp

the nuance, the hidden variable. These studies, craftily overdressed as “empirical”,”

' The relevance of this procedural instrument within the framework of international investment arbitration
had been underlined by the chief counsel for claimant in the first ICSID case, namely Professor Pierre
LALIVE, The First ‘World Bank’ Arbitration (Holiday Inns v. Morocco) — Some Legal Problems, 1 ICSID
Reports, Cambridge, 1993, 654: “The magnitude and complexity of most international disputes, involving
inescapably long periods of time before any decision or amicable settlement can be reached, give the
question of provisional measures considerable significance”.

seem to be inevitably oversimplistic, and still they are focused on awards! It would be
even more misleading to apply the same type of doubtful method to such a fluid object
as provisional measures.

Anyway, this analysis has been conducted through continuous tests on the
‘differentiated approach’ described in the previous chapter. However, it has been
necessary to adapt the tool to a different environment, where history plays a less
significant role and comparison is made in the same area, namely public international
law. Indeed, the main structural thesis advanced in this study, the most significant
empirical result of my provisional analysis — as far as the general framework 1s
concerned — is that international investment arbitration is inscribed in public
international law.

Short of addressing the topic of fragmentation / proliferation, which is outside of its
purpose, it is nonetheless deemed appropriate to at least mention the necessity to refuse
considering this branch as a self-contained régime and — more importantly — to continue
testing the differentiated approach, so as to avoid normative dogmas. The enterprise
shall not be taken for granted, since the unity of international law is experiencing many
challenges at various levels,* due to the activity of international organisations,
regionalism, unilateralism and bilateralism. However, some studies are indicating that
proliferation of adjudicatory organs in international law tends to a certain extent to lead
to the apparently counterintuitive phenomenon of de-fragmentation.”

For the sake of clarity, it has to be noted that the notion of self-contained régime
constitutes a valid description of ICSID arbitration only when referred to the integrity of
the proceedings’ (for instance, as we will explore below, in relation to the exclusive

jurisdiction enjoyed by arbitral tribunals to rule upon provisional measures) and other

its consent to arbitration under this Convention”. The text of the Convention and the relevant provisions

peri-arbitral issues° characterising it as a delocalised mechanism. In any manner, this
shall be distinguished from its theoretical foundation in the global sphere. In the words

of Paul Friedland:

“All the same, ICSID arbitration is a self-contained system, established by treaty by the member
States, and the Convention’s exclusive remedy rule reflects the need shared by both host states
and foreign investors for international adjudication of potentially politically-tinged investments

disputes without interference from the courts of the nation of either party (or of any other

: 7
nation)”.

Indeed, such attribution is nothing more and nothing less than an expression of the
sovereign renunciation to have recourse to the institution of diplomatic protection® and,
to amore general extent, to reduce the impact of politically-oriented interference.

The theoretical purpose of this study is to explore the existing interrelationships
between adjudicatory organs and their jurisprudences in the public-international-law
framework — including investor-State dispute settlement — regarding provisional
measures.

These measures constitute a significant indicator of the degree of jurisdictionalisation’

acquired by the ICSID framework, wherein it is more advanced than in international

° On the contrary, post-arbitral issues, namely recognition and enforcement of the award, inescapably fall
within the jurisdiction of State courts, i.e. those in which enforcement is sought by the winning party, due
to the general lack of imperium of arbitral tribunals. However, the ICSID framework contains significant
advancements towards effectiveness also in this regard, enshrined in Art. 54 of the Convention.

* According to Art. 27, para. 1, of the ICSID Convention, “(1) No Contracting State shall give diplomatic
protection, or bring an international claim, in respect of a dispute which one of its nationals and another
Contracting State shall have consented to submit or shall have submitted to arbitration under this
Convention, unless such other Contracting State shall have failed to abide by and comply with the award
rendered in such dispute”.

* The nexus between the power to rule upon provisional measures and the jurisdictionalisation of the
arbitral tribunal as a construction in international commercial arbitration was illustrated by Professor
Philippe Fouchard in the monograph resulting from his doctoral thesis, L’arbitrage commercial
international, Paris, 1965, 121 f.: “Si un certain nombre d’institutions arbitrales, poussant fort loin leur <<
juridictionnalisation >> autorisent les arbitres a prendre eux-mémes les mesures provisoires et
conservatoires qui leur paraissent s’imposer, d’autres, parmi lesquelles il faut signaler la Chambre de
commerce internationale, certaines institutions de l’Est, la Fédération internationale du commerce des
semences et les Régles de Copenhague et VInternational Law Association renvoient expressément les
parties devant les tribunaux de l’ordre judiciaire pour toute mesure conservatoire ou provisoire”

commercial arbitration and investment arbitration under non-ICSID fora, due to the
treaty source upon which it is based. A manifestation of such increased
jurisdictionalisation is given by the exclusive-jurisdiction v. concurrent-jurisdiction
binomial, dealt with below.'°

As amatter of fact, they constitute quite a new phenomenon in this area of arbitration. If
we divide it chronologically into two periods, namely the “classical period” — from the
1930s until the ICSID and UNCITRAL started to blossom — and the contemporary one
— running therefrom onwards, i.e. the last fifteen years —, we notice that in the first
phase they are almost absent. One explanation may be that the possibility for a private
investor to file an international claim against the host State, without the necessity of a
“protector”, '' yet constituted a significant step in the new conception of State
sovereignty. Thus, the implementation'’ of provisional measures would have been an
excessively audacious step forward.

Short of addressing in these lines such a complex issue as that of the proper formula for
the transnational government and protection of outward investments, I nonetheless
deem it appropriate to mention one of the most authoritative XIX-century publicists,
Carlos Calvo. Indeed, he warned contemporary and future generations against the trend
towards a differentiated protection of aliens in investment matters. Moreover, he
strongly advocated national treatment of both foreign and national investors — the so-
called Calvo clause — and adjudication by host State courts. The Argentinian scholar
maintained that, in the absence of national treatment, two enormous inequalities and
corresponding privileges would be perpetuated: an interior one, namely privilege for
foreign investors, coupled with an exterior one, 1.e. that of the powerful State upon the

weak.

'° See Section one, B.

'' Reference is made to the institution of diplomatic protection, which accompanied the treatment of
aliens since the inception of the modern era of international law.

'? The very existence of the instrument may not be questioned even in relation to this early period, if it is
accepted under the inherent-power theory as a normal attribution of any adjudicative organ.

Ph.D. Thesis — Federico Lenci

This sovereignist conception of FDIs contributes to the explanation of such a long
resistance'* to employ provisional measures and to attribute them binding force, as we
will see in this chapter, moving from a deferential attitude to a new conception of the
relationship between the individual and the Sovereign.

Under this light, compliance with provisional measures can be considered, from a
macro perspective, a thermometer of the state of health of international investment
arbitration as an effective and respected dispute settlement mechanism, in the
manichean struggle between communitarianism and individualism. Moreover, this
procedural instrument constitutes a test bench of investor-State dispute settlement
(ISDS) as it addresses and, at the same time, exacerbates the asymmetries of

international investment arbitration in our times, in two respects:

- it attempts to limit State sovereignty on a provisional basis, since arbitrators are
empowered to order the defendant State to freeze the impact of its own legislation on
the claimant, its criminal or bankruptcy proceedings and other regulatory measures

deemed — instrumentally or not — to serve the public interest;

- it shows its weakness in the necessity — lacking an advanced system of enforcement —
of State’s own compliance for the engine to function, or at least all the set of liquid

constraints, as we will see in the final chapter (IV).

especiales no hayan podido consolidar su situacion politica: y no escucharian nunca las reclamaciones
que bajo este respecto les hicieran los segundos teniendo estos, en cambio, que atender y cumplir las
suyas, como ha sucedido en mas de una ocasion con las indemnizaciones pedidas por algunos gobiernos
de Europa 4 los Estados suramericanos. Mas no supondria solamente lo que acabamos de decir, sino que
equivaldria 4 conceder un privilegio injustificable 4 favor de los extranjeros y contrario 4 los naturales. Si
estos no tienen derecho alguno 4 exigir que se les resarza de los dafios y perjuicios que hayan sufrido,
como han de tenerse los demas? La consecuencia inmediata, ineludible, de reconocer semejante principio
seria el sostenimiento de dos grandes desigualdades y dos enormes privilegios: una interior, privilegio de
los extranjeros, y otra exterior, que lo seria del Estado mas fuerte”.

' The resistance to enter this “new” era of mixed dipsute settlement had two facets, procedural and
substantive: as sketched in the first chapter, while the first one was overcome through the general
adoption of the ICSID framework from 1965 onwards, agreement on the substantive regulations of
foreign investment is still lacking, despite numerous attempts to embody it in a multilateral convention,
such as in recent years the “Multilateral Agreement on Investments” (MAI). Quite curiously indeed, this
acronym reads “never” in the Italian language: perhaps it gives an indication of the feasibility of such an
agreement.

178

Furthermore, recourse to provisional measures gives relevant indications also from a
micro perspective: indeed, the outcome of the request for these measures allows the
parties to better realise elements of strenght and weakness of their respective cases as
provisionally evaluated by the arbitral tribunal. Therefore, it influences their strategy for

15
the next moves.

Another hint of the accrued relevance of provisional measures is the geographical
enlargement of international investment arbitration as a dispute settlement mechanism
regarding FDIs to regions which were traditionally cold in this respect. As an example, I
refer here to MERCOSUR member States, namely Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay,
Uruguay and Venezuela. Indeed, recently MERCOSUR Common Market Council
adopted Decision No. 30/10 providing the premise for an upcoming agreement on
investments.'® The text highlights the relevance of two frameworks — one concerning
intra-regional investments, the other relating to extra-regional investments — for the
development of the internal common market in the region, in line with the purposes of
MERCOSUR since the adoption of its founding instrument, namely the Treaty of
Asuncion in 1991.'” Specialised legal literature has indicated the path which will likely
be followed in this process, namely basing the new model on the investment chapter of
NAFTA — Chapter 11 — or the model BITs implemented by the United States and
Canada.'* These instruments, and in particular the special place they attribute to
provisional measures, contributing to the recent phenomenon of treatification thereof,”
showcase the vitality of our topic and provide avenues for development which are worth

mentioning.”’

'° A similar point, though more broadly referred to the whole adjudicating process, was made by

Professor Pierre LALIVE, The First ‘World Bank’ Arbitration quoted supra footnote 1, 645 f., when he
stated that international arbitration “normally enables the parties to obtain, in the course of time, a clearer
perception of the merits and demerits of their respective cases and arguments”.

Paraphrasing Professor Gaillard, who aptly says that “arbitration is a mechanism with
teeth”,”' I venture to submit — and try to demonstrate in this chapter and the following
one — that provisional measures are its front teeth.

Short of adopting a definitive position on the role of arbitral tribunals” and the use of
precedents in international investment law,”° I shall try to contain my research to the
analysis of the current status of provisional measures in this field; at the same time, I
feel compelled to observe that it contains each and every tension that international law
is going through in this period. Arguably, it gives an even stronger indication that this
area of law is inscribed within the public-international-law framework. I refer in
particular to the dualism between autonomy and community in the international legal
project, considering that international law constitutes a structure that expresses the
victorious social demands at a given moment of the world order. Martti Koskenniem1
made this point very clearly in a passage of his masterpiece From Apology to Utopia,

reading as follows:

“It [the international legal project, A/N] describes social life among States alternatively in terms
of community and autonomy. These descriptions support conflicting demands for freedom and
order. In the one case, community is interpreted as negative collectivism and autonomy
(independence, self-determination) is presented as the normative goal. In the other, autonomy is

interpreted as negative egoism and community (integration, solidarity) as what the law should

*! Economist, Now Try Collecting, article on this summer’s 50bIn-award in the Yukos case, published on
2 August 2014, whose first lines read as follows: “Russia breached its obligations under an energy treaty
when it seized the assets of Yukos in 2006; so it must pay the former oil giant’s majority shareholders
$50 billion. The award, made on July 28th by an international arbitration court in The Hague, was 20
times the previous record for such a case. The investors’ lead lawyer, Emmanuel Gaillard of Shearman &
Sterling, says it shows that arbitration is “a mechanism with teeth”.

** Tt is worth recalling here the advice to commercial arbitrators venturing in the investment field, which
is characterised by a stronger necessity to build up its framework, whereby“the prudent commercial
arbitrator venturing into investment arbitration territory should never lose sight of the public-order aspect
of this type of arbitration”, in VAN HOUTTE, BRUNETTI, quoted supra footnote 7, 574; see also STONE
SWEET, /nvestor-State Arbitration: Proportionality's New Frontier, Yale Law Faculty Scholarship Series
- Paper 69, 2010, 9: “If the arbitrator is not merely the Agent of two contracting Principals, but an Agent
of the greater community, then one might ask if (or assume that) the arbitrator has a responsibility to take
into account the community’s interests in decisions. There exists a great deal of evidence showing that
this is, in fact, happening. More and more decisions are being published, and certain kinds of decisions
are treated by subsequent litigators as having precedential value. Scholars refer to the emergence of an
“arbitral common law,” tailored to the needs of specific categories of traders, built as the common law
has traditionally been built, through reasons given that subsequently congeal as precedent”.

aim at. Neither community nor autonomy can be exclusive goals. To think of community as the
ultimate goal seems utopian: as there is no agreement on the character of a desirable
community, attempts to impose it seem like imperialism in disguise. To think of autonomy as

the normative aim seems apologist: it strenghtens the absolutist claims of national power-elites

and supports their pursuits at international dominance”.

The autonomy/community opposition, reminiscent of the ius positum / ius naturale
confrontation of mindsets, throughout the second half of the XIX century and the first
half of the XX century, finds its way within the international investment framework:
such a global law setting seems to be precisely at a crossroads between the two systems,
the Charter system and the Westphalian system. The opposition between the two
models in the investment arena guarantees their mutual legitimacy: the horizontal,
Westphalian-system, sovereignist, case-by-case approach exists and perpetuates itself
precisely as a reaction to the vertical, Charter-system, solidarist, general-framework
one. And every arbitral panel may constitute the theoretical battlefield between these

two representations.

Section one: specific features of provisional measures

in ICSID arbitration

A. Differences between ICSID and other investment arbitration fora: focus on the
binding force of provisional measures

I. ICSID arbitration. — II. Other investment arbitration fora.

A.I. The binding versus recommendatory force of provisional measures constitutes the
noyau dur of our topic, as the impact of such instrument on the arbitral procedure
depends thereupon.

It shall be said that a clear-cut distinction will be drawn between the analysis of the
force of such measures and their enforceability.” Indeed, one thing is to evaluate that
they may lack binding force, whereas quite another is to affirm that such measures are
not enforceable without voluntary compliance of the State (incidentally, I do not share
either of the two assumptions, for the reasons presented in this chapter): the two
analytical plans shall not be mixed up.*® My point is that the deepest fallacies and

obstacles to the evolution of provisional measures, in contexts where imperium 1s

*° See, in this sense, BOSCO LEE, ALVES, Arbitraje y medidas cautelares en Latinoamérica, 11 GAILLARD,
FERNANDEZ ARROYO (dir.), Cuestiones claves del arbitraje internacional, Bogota y D.C., 2013, 113: “El
poder de conceder medidas cautelares proviene del propio poder de jurisdiccion del arbitro. Sin embargo,
como el arbitro esta desprovisto del poder de imperium, durante mucho tiempo se entendi6 que el tribunal
arbitral no podia ordenar medidas cautelares. Ese razonamiento es totalmente equivocado pues la falta de
imperium implica la imposibilidad del tribunal arbitral de ejecutar las medidas cautelares, pero no excluye
su competencia para conocer sobre el pedido de urgencia, que esta directamente conectado a su poder de
conduccion del procedimiento y de juzgar el fondo de la controversia” [footnotes omitted, A/N]; ORREGO
VICUNA, The Evolving Nature of Provisional Measures, in FERNANDEZ BALLESTEROS, ARIAS (eds.),
Liber Amicorum Bernardo Cremades, Madrid, 2010, 950: “[...] it is appropriate to make the distinction
between the question of the binding nature of the measures adopted and that of their enforceability”.

°° For an example of mixing up of the two analytical plans, see RSM v. Saint Lucia, Decision on Saint
Lucia’s request for security for costs dated 13 August 2014, paras. 49-50: “Despite the wording of the
cited provision that indicates that the Tribunal may (only) “recommend” provisional measures, it is well
settled among ICSID tribunals that such decisions are binding. Accordingly, the term “recommend” is to
be understood as meaning “order”. 50. However, the distinction between a “recommendation” and an
“order” in connection with provisional measures remains a theoretical rather than a practical issue.
Irrespective of this distinction, provisional measures issued by an ICSID tribunal do not have a binding
effect in terms of being enforceable (e contrario Article 54(1) ICSID Convention). Hence, the question
whether the Tribunal “recommends” or “orders” provisional measures is in any case irrelevant for the
nature and effect of the respective measure. However, a tribunal can draw negative inferences from the
non-compliance with provisional measures” [footnotes omitted, A/N].

lacking, consist precisely in the confusion between said two plans. This attitude may be
due to excess of realism — bordering nihilism — and in any case shall be avoided.

Undoubtedly, there exists a connection between the two plans, since only binding
measures can be enforced; indeed, the fallacy consists precisely in the adoption of plan
two (enforcement) to describe plan one (legal authority). Besides, measures to enforce

provisional orders are available, as will be indicated in the last chapter of this study.’

The case law of ICSID tribunals has been evolving from a deferential attitude towards
the parties — in particular towards the State, for obvious reasons — to a more assertive
and firm stance, as its jurisdictionalisation has gradually been achieved. The first ICSID
case, Holiday Inns v. Morocco, was characterised by a particularly cautious approach.
In 1966, an agreement was entered into between the Government of Morocco and the
American group Holiday Inns for the construction of four hotels in order to contribute
to the development of organized tourism and group travel in the country. Some conflicts
arose in relation to the implementation of the project due to alleged delays and cessation
of payments and, on 22 December 1971, the Claimant filed a request for arbitration
under the arbitral clause contained in the investor-State contract, providing for ICSID
arbitration.”® The issue of provisional measures appeared on the ICSID stage at its very
first act, namely the first session of the first arbitral proceeding:”’ counsel for Claimant
made an oral request and was invited by the arbitral tribunal to make a written
submission. On 12 May 1972, Claimant submitted a request for provisional measures
asking the tribunal to direct Respondent to discontinue local proceedings the latter had
instituted in January that year for the appointment of a judicial administrator to maintain
the hotels under operation. The request aimed at safeguarding the integrity of the
proceedings, according to Art. 26 of the ICSID Convention which provides for the rule
of exclusivity, failing a written agreement to the contrary between the parties. It relied

on

7 Concern about the risk of mixing up the two plans warranted keeping the division between issuance
and enforcement of provisional measures in two distinct chapters.

°8 No data are available in the ICSID instituional website, therefore all relevant pieces of information
about the proceedings are drawn from Professor Lalive’s account in his article The First ‘World Bank
Arbitration’ quoted supra footnote 1.

*° For an account of the first session see LALIVE, P., quoted supra footnote 1, 655.

Provisional Measures in International Investment Arbitration
Ph.D. Thesis — Federico Lenci

“The principle universally admitted by international tribunals... to the effect that the parties to a
case must abstain from any measure capable of exercising a prejudicial effect in regard to the

execution of the decision to be given and, in general, not allow any step of any kind to be taken

which may aggravate or extend the dispute”.*”

It shall be noted that the classic provisional measures directing one or more parties to
abstain from measures likely to aggravate or extend the dispute aims at two goals, in
favour of two different actors in the arbitral scene: 1) the requesting party, which would
otherwise be affected by the conduct of its opponent and 2) the arbitral tribunal itself,
whose authority risks being undermined and its adjudicative task complicated if said

conduct keeps on being carried out.

On 2 July 1972, the arbitral tribunal handed down its decision, described as “a strong
one on the legal principles involved while in concreto extremely prudent (some would
even say timid)”.*' Indeed, it firmly asserted its jurisdiction to issue provisional
measures in principle, whereas in that particular case it appeared reluctant to affirm its
authority with regard to a Sovereign State, inviting the parties to abstain from acting in
a manner incompatible with the upholding of the contract, to exchange information
concerning the activities of the hotels and to consult each other in order to maintain the
character of the overall enterprise.*”

Subsequent cases of ICSID’s early period confirmed such a deferential attitude

. . . 33
concerning the legal authority of provisional measures.

°° Thid., 656. The author also referred in this respect to two cases analysed in chapter two, namely
Electricity Company of Sofia and Bulgaria case before the PCIJ and the Case concerning US Diplomatic
and Consular Staff in Teheran before the ICJ.

*! Tbid., 658. Professor Lalive cited in full the decision, reported here: “The Parties were in agreement to
recognize before the Tribunal that at the date of this Decision contractual relations remain in existence
between them based on a series of commitments the foundation of which apparently is the Contract of
December 5, 1966. It follows that the Parties are under an obligation to abstain from all measures likely to
prevent definitely the execution of their obligations. The Tribunal therefore considers that it has
jurisdiction to recommend provisional measures according to the terms of Article 47 of the Convention
on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, the Parties still
having the right to express, in the rest of the procedure, any exception relating to the jurisdiction of the
Tribunal on any other aspect of the dispute”. It is noted that the arbitral tribunal upheld a very low
threshold as far as the jurisdictional requirement to issue provisional measures is concerned (an implicit
one), even lower than the one adopted in the ICJ Anglo-Iranian Oil Co. case.

184
Provisional Measures in International Investment Arbitration
Ph.D. Thesis — Federico Lenci

In order to address this point, it is necessary to start from the conventional text. As
already indicated, the term “recommend” is adopted in art. 47 of the ICSID Convention,
which reads as follows:

“Except as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal may, if 1t considers that the circumstances
so require, recommend any provisional measures which should be taken to preserve the

respective rights of either party”.

Following the objective interpretation of the ordinary meaning of the treaty text
pursuant to Art. 31, para. 1, of the VCLT, one may inclined to dismiss in limine the
issue, concluding that ICSID arbitral tribunals are not empowered to issue binding
provisional measures. Additionally, may I refer to the travaux préparatoires of the
Convention:** indeed, the Working Paper, the Preliminary Draft and the First Draft
provided for the arbitrators’ authority to prescribe’’ provisional measures.*° As noted in
Professor Schreuer’s Commentary, the delegate from China opposed such an extended
power, due to the concern that the State party to the dispute might be unable to abide by
the provisional measures prescribed for reasons of “necessity on national policy”.*’
Following a vote thereupon, the term “recommend” substituted the term “prescribe” by
a large majority.*®

Under these circumstances, le débat est clos. Indeed, one may fail to understand a
departure from such a clear meaning of the treaty text and its drafting history:
consequently, any decision issued by an ICSID arbitral tribunal whereby provisional
measures are ordered would be dismissed as having manifestly exceeded its power.
However, despite the aforesaid limitation, ICSID arbitral tribunals developed a very

Provisional Measures in International Investment Arbitration
Ph.D. Thesis — Federico Lenci

The first case in the ICSID framework where the word “recommend” was explicitly
deemed to be of equivalent value to the word “order” was Maffezini v. Spain.’ It can
tentatively be affirmed that the nature of the party requesting a provisional measure —
the State — and the type of measure requested — security for costs*” — may have had an
impact on the arbitral tribunal’s decision to increase its legal authority, in relation to the
then prevailing jurisprudence. This decision was harshly criticised: indeed, one of its
most delicate comments was that the Maffezini case evidenced that “this concern of the
drafters of the Convention [i.e., to avoid attributing binding force to ICSID arbitrators’
provisional measures, 4/N] was set aside by less respectful ICSID tribunals”.”!
However, it has to be inserted in a broader context, in which dates and the temporal
succession of events play a significant role. One year before said decision, the ICJ
developed its jurisprudence in the same respect, delivering an indication of provisional
measures whereby the United States were ordered to halt the procedure which would
lead to the execution of a Paraguayan citizen named Breard.””

It is noted that the Court was induced to increase the degree of its power due to obvious
humanitarian reasons, since in this case — followed within a period of less than five

years by the La Grand” and Avena*’ cases — human life was at stake.” This episode

manifests that ICSID arbitral tribunals are constantly — and to an increasing pace —
influenced by the construction of public international law as interpreted and applied by
the ICJ. Such a judicial borrowing, so far unilateral,”® contributes to giving evidence — if
need be — that the two “systems” constitute a single legal order, wherein the investment
framework differs ratione materiae, on the adjudication mechanism and so forth, but
still within the same set of applicable rules and procedural settings. The analysis of such
cross-fertilisations contributes to a better understanding of the special features of
international investment arbitration — as distinguished from international commercial

arbitration — in three steps:

- the mixed system of dispute settlement as far as parties are concerned (private / public;

private / private) alters the normative setting;

- exclusive and contractualistic adherence to the treaty text is unable to properly address

such variances;
- investment arbitration is inscribed in the public-international-law framework.

In addition, the precise meaning of the travaux préparatoires has to be explained in
more details. Indeed, the debate about the binding or recommendatory force of
provisional measures was determined by an external factor, namely the opportunity to
incorporate decisions granting provisional measures in the form of an interim award, for
the purpose of enforcement. Eventually, the latter option was rejected and the legal
authority of said decisions reduced.*’ It is easily to perceive once again the confusion
between the plan of the legal authority of provisional measures and that of their
enforcement. Curiously indeed, the same dynamic occurred in the debate upon the

establishment of the PCIJ, where eventually the term “indicate” substituted the term

“order”.”* Therefore, the drafting history of the recommend — order binomial is to be

read as favouring the interpretation of the binding legal authority of provisional
measures, to which nobody within the Drafting Committee had objected.

Other references are contained in its ancillary instrument, namely the Arbitration Rules,
adopted by the Administrative Council of the Centre according to Art. 6, para. 1 lett. c
of the ICSID Convention: Art. 39 provides that

“(1) At any time after the institution of the proceeding, a party may request that provisional
measures for the preservation of its rights be recommended by the Tribunal. The request shall
specify the rights to be preserved, the measures the recommendation of which is requested, and
the circumstances that require such measures.

(2) The Tribunal shall give priority to the consideration of a request made pursuant to paragraph

(1).

(3) The Tribunal may also recommend provisional measures on its own initiative or recommend
measures other than those specified in a request. It may at any time modify or revoke its

recommendations.

(4) The Tribunal shall only recommend provisional measures, or modify or revoke its

recommendations, after giving each party an opportunity of presenting its observations.

(5) If a party makes a request pursuant to paragraph (1) before the constitution of the Tribunal,
the Secretary-General shall, on the application of either party, fix time limits for the parties to
present observations on the request, so that the request and observations may be considered by

the Tribunal promptly upon its constitution.

(6) Nothing in this Rule shall prevent the parties, provided that they have so stipulated in the
agreement recording their consent, from requesting any judicial or other authority to order
provisional measures, prior to or after the institution of the proceeding, for the preservation of

their respective rights and interests”.

Provisional Measures in International Investment Arbitration
Ph.D. Thesis — Federico Lenci

In this regard, it has to be noted that the term recommend is contained in paragraphs 1, 3
and 4, 1.e. in the early provisions; instead, in the other two paragraphs (paragraph 5,
inserted in 2006; paragraph 6, inserted in 1985) there is no such reference. On the
contrary, paragraph 6 adopts the term order in relation to domestic courts, to which the
parties may have recourse with requests for provisional measures (provided the
existence of an earlier written agreement to that effect). I consider such insertions as a
further evidence of the evolution towards the binding force of ICSID provisional
measures, for the following reason: the different quality of imperium may otherwise
produce a harmful effect to the general framework of this dispute settlement
mechanism.

If taken at its face value, 1t would imply that in the context of concurrent jurisdiction,
the ICSID arbitral tribunal would lack the power to order a modification or cessation of
court-ordered provisional measures; consequently, a serious threat to the integrity of
proceedings and to the very adjudicatory function of the arbitral tribunal would arise:
the arbitral tribunal would be subordinated to the authority of domestic courts in relation
to fundamental aspects of fair administration of justice, such as the handling of
evidence, security for costs, and so forth. This would manifestly run contrary to the
necessity of ICSID tribunals to avoid external, potentially politically-biased,
interference, namely the purpose for which the ICSID dispute settlement mechanism
was created. It would lead to an absurdity and, consequently, allows a harmonising
interpretation: at least since the moment when the rule was introduced, twenty years
after the Convention and the originary Arbitration Rules, ICSID arbitral tribunals are
empowered to order provisional measures.

Furthermore, it is relevant to consider art. 47 of the ICSID Additional Facility (AF)

Arbitration Rules,” providing for both orders and recommendations:

” On 27 September 1978, the Administrative Council of the Centre authorized the Secretariat to
administer at the request of the parties concerned certain proceedings between States and nationals of
other States falling outside the scope of the ICSID Convention. It concerns three groups of proceedings:
1- conciliation or arbitration proceedings for the settlement of investment disputes arising between parties
one of which is not a Contracting State or a national of a Contracting State; 2- conciliation or arbitration
proceedings between parties at least one of which is a Contracting State or a national of a Contracting
State for the settlement of disputes that do not directly arise out of an investment; 3- fact-finding
proceedings.

Provisional Measures in International Investment Arbitration
Ph.D. Thesis — Federico Lenci

(1) Unless the arbitration agreement otherwise provides, either party may at any time
during the proceeding request that provisional measures for the preservation of its rights
be ordered by the Tribunal. The Tribunal shall give priority to the consideration of such
a request.

(2) The Tribunal may also recommend provisional measures on its own initiative or
recommend measures other than those specified in a request. It may at any time modify
or revoke its recommendations.

(3) The Tribunal shall order or recommend provisional measures, or any modification or
revocation thereof, only after giving each party an opportunity of presenting its
observations.

(4) The parties may apply to any competent judicial authority for interim or conservatory
measures. By doing so they shall not be held to infringe the agreement to arbitrate or to

affect the powers of the Tribunal.

The origin of these Rules prevents an automatically analogic reading of its text in
combination with the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules; however, it constitutes
a relevant element in the appropriate construction of the evolving nature of arbitrators’
interim powers. These indications shall be inserted in the broader context of public-
international-law adjudication, comprising the practice of the ICJ, ITLOS, ECtHR and
Iran-US Claims tribunals. Moreover, so far parties to ICSID arbitration have never
raised on this aspect the issue of manifest excess of powers as a ground for annulment
pursuant to Art. 52, para. 1, lett. b, which may be considered as a further element of

acceptance of arbitrators’ binding power.

Arbitral tribunals in recent cases do not even feel the necessity to refer in detail to
earlier cases in order to establish their binding power: for example, the ICSID tribunal
in Tethyan Copper v. Pakistan, immediately after quoting Art. 47 ICSID Convention,
affirms in the same paragraph that “thus, there is no question that the Tribunal has the
authority to order provisional measures to preserve a party’s right”; however, it is

worth mentioning that the tribunal in Perenco v. Ecuador referred to ICSID tribunals’

inherent power, coupled with a vast collection of precedents in public-international-law

adjudication.”!

A.IL. Art. 26 of the 2010 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules provides for interim measures,
an expression analogous to that of provisional measures in the ICSID framework. This
version has been significantly expanded in comparison to the corresponding article in
the 1976 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. James Castello, who actively participated in
both working groups that carried out the reform of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules
and the Model Law,” explained that the main reason consisted in the necessity to seek
cooperation from domestic courts where said measures had to be decided upon and/or
enforced and to their idiosyncrasy to do so if the scope of the arbitrator’s power was
broad (since they read it as unclear).”°

Conditions, purposes and atypicalness of provisional measures are contained,
respectively, in paragraph 3,°* paragraph 2 letters (a)-(b)-(c)-(d)”> and paragraph 2,

The binding force of interim measures is not expressly affirmed in the first paragraph in
a clear form: indeed, the arbitral tribunal may grant interim measures; however,

or an order — may have an impact on its enforceability, not — it is worth repeating the
point — on its binding force, which appears to be stronger than its counterpart in the
ICSID framework.”’

The form containing a decision on interim measures is not provided for in Article 26.
Undoubtedly, interim measures issued in the form of awards are more likely to be
enforceable than orders, since the 1958 New York Convention on the recognition and
enforcement of foreign arbitral awards only refers to “awards”.’® A reason for such a
reticence with regard to the form of the decision on interim measures was due to the fact
that, since awards are final, this element would run contrary to the typical provisional
and modifiable character of interim measures, able to lead to some confusion in
connection with Art. 26, para. 5.°’ According to Caron and Caplan, such a view is
“overly formalistic’, since there is no discussion on the fact that interim measures can
be granted in the form of an award.°”

In some cases, the text of the applicable treaty can shed some light on the point of the
binding force: it constitutes one of the manifestations of the phenomenon called
treatification of provisional measures, where the treaty plays the role of lex specialis in
relation to the relevant arbitration rules (CSID, UNCITRAL, and so forth); said
phenomenon will arguably become increasingly relevant in future treaty negotiations
and, consequently, arbitrations. An example in this sense has been given by the EnCana
Corp. v. Government of Ecuador case.°' Claimant sought interim measures to prevent
freezing of assets of EnCana subsidiaries and its legal representative pending
arbitration. Two different provisions dealt with interim measures: the UNCITRAL
Arbitration Rules (in particular, the 1976 version) and Art. XIII(8) of the applicable
BIT, namely the one between Canada and Ecuador. Art. XIII(8) provides:

“A tribunal may order an interim measure of protection to preserve the rights of a disputing
party, or to ensure that the tribunal’s jurisdiction is made fully effective, including an order to
preserve evidence in the possession or control of a disputing party or to protect the tribunal’s
jurisdiction. A tribunal may not order attachment or enjoin the application of the measure
alleged to constitute a breach of this Agreement. For purposes of this paragraph, an order

includes a recommendation’.

The arbitral tribunal found that, since the treaty provision was specifically applicable to
investments by Canadian corporations in Ecuador (and vice versa), it prevailed over the
general power contained in Art. 26 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.” The clear meaning
of the BIT provision indicated that it had the authority to issue binding interim
measures.

In Chevron Corp. v. Republic of Ecuador, the arbitral tribunal, after denying a different
degree of normativity of its decision according to the form adopted,” declared that “this
order shall be immediately final and binding upon all Parties, subject only to any
subsequent variation made by the Tribunal (upon either its own initiative or any Party’s
request”.
The practice of the Iran-US Claims Tribunal has confirmed the binding power of
interim measures under the UNCITRAL Rules, generally relying upon the theory of

inherent powers: the theory plays the dual role of establishing jurisdiction to issue

such measures and at the same time affirming binding force. In Rockwell v. Iran, the

B. Comparing ICSID with UNCITRAL investment arbitration: exclusive v.
concurring jurisdiction between State court and arbitral tribunal

I. ICSID arbitration. — II. Investment arbitration under the UNCITRAL Rules.

B.I. The ICSID Convention provides that agreement to ICSID arbitration prevents the
Parties from having recourse to any other form of settlement, in the absence of a written
agreement to the contrary.” As a consequence, ICSID arbitral proceedings theoretically
bar any other form of judicial peri-arbitral intervention or control. Said feature
characterises its self-contained régime.

Particularly for our purposes, in many instances — not all, particularly in the early period
of ICSID as we will see — State courts found that they lacked jurisdiction to issue
provisional measures in connection with arbitral proceedings pending before ICSID
tribunals, provided that the Parties had not otherwise agreed. Such a peculiar feature of
ICSID arbitration, as far as provisional measures are concerned, is hereby called
exclusive jurisdiction, pointing precisely to the exclusion of State court intervention
pending proceedings.

Undoubtedly, State court intervention remains necessary in the post-arbitral phase,
namely when recognition, enforcement and execution of the award are sought, due to
the arbitral tribunal’s lack of imperium in that regard.

Exclusive jurisdiction constitutes a key distinctive factor between ICSID arbitration
and international commercial arbitration or international investment arbitration
administered by non-ICSID arbitral institutions,” which on the contrary — on this point
— are characterised by concurring jurisdiction as an accepted principle under a large
majority of arbitral rules in administered as well as ad hoc arbitration: indeed, in the
latter instance the submission of a claim before an arbitral tribunal does not prevent

State courts from issuing provisional measures aimed at safeguarding the rights of either

party.

° Art. 26 ICSID Convention: “Consent of the parties to arbitration under this Convention shall, unless
otherwise stated, be deemed consent to such arbitration to the exclusion of any other remedy. A
Contracting State may require the exhaustion of local administrative or judicial remedies as a condition of
its consent to arbitration under this Convention”.

” The most relevant non-ICSID administered international investment arbitration fora are the ICC, LCIA
and Stockholm Chamber of Commerce.

195
Provisional Measures in International Investment Arbitration
Ph.D. Thesis — Federico Lenci

For the sake of completeness, it has to be noted that exclusive jurisdiction does not
constitute a mandatory provision of the ICSID framework, as in 1985 Art. 39 of the
ICSID Arbitration Rules was amended, including a new paragraph 5 — from 2006
paragraph 6’'— whereby the Parties were allowed to opt out of the exclusive-
jurisdiction rule by expressly establishing in writing that they retained their power to
request provisional measures from State courts. In 1993, Model Clause no. 14 had been
drafted in that respect, so as to facilitate the parties’ intention to provide for the
availability of court-ordered provisional measures. The model clause at issue only
presented a concurring-jurisdiction option, whereas it could also have provided to
exclusive jurisdiction in favour of national courts (indeed, the text of Art. 47 of the
ICSID Convention opens to such an option: “Except as the Parties otherwise agree...”’).

Model Clause no. 14 reads as follows:

“Without prejudice to the power of the Arbitral Tribunal to recommend provisional measures,
either party hereto may request any judicial or other authority to order any provisional or

conservatory measure, including attachment, prior to the institution of the arbitration

proceeding, or during the proceeding, for the preservation of its rights and interests”.

This clause acknowledges national court’s imperium to order provisional measures —
while at that time case law and prevalent doctrine considered that ICSID tribunals only
had recommendatory authority — and excludes the necessity of their jurisdiction on the
merits” for such measures to be issued (providing that the party may request any
judicial or other authority to order them).

Then, such a waiver shall automatically be regarded as a waiver to the exclusivity of
ICSID proceedings under Art. 26 of the ICSID Convention, provided that such

limitation shall operate only in relation to provisional measures, whereas Art. 26 has a

" Indeed, in 2006 a new paragraph 5 was inserted in Art. 39 of the Arbitration Rules, providing for an
accelerated procedure for the decision on provisional measures: “If a party makes a request pursuant to
paragraph (1) before the constitution of the Tribunal, the Secretary-General shall, on the application of
either party, fix time limits for the parties to present observations on the request, so that the requests and
observations may be considered by the Tribunal promptly upon its constitution”.

wider scope embracing all types of parallel proceedings. The system has thus become
voluntary; this being said, such an option has not met so far with wide application.

The exclusive / concurrent binomial has to be distinguished from other forms of peri-
arbitral judicial intervention, whose aim is not that of assisting-implementing the
arbitral procedure, but rather the contrary, i.e. to obstruct the proceedings through the
creation of the phenomenon of parallel proceedings, which will be dealt with in another
Section.”

The novelty introduced by the ICSID framework in relation to the exclusivity rule upon
provisional measures was not readily accepted by the actors in the international arena,
especially in its first years of operation.

In the first ICSID case, Holiday Inns v. Morocco, the Government — desirous to
continue operating the hotels and their facilities — did not file a request for provisional
measures with the ICSID tribunal, but referred to the local courts in Morocco adopting
the summary procedure of référé. They thus obtained the authorisation to resume and
complete construction at its opponent’s expenses, in violation of Art. 26 of the ICSID
Convention.”

Actually, until 1984 the issue regarding the availability of provisional measures from
domestic courts was controversial, ’° given the silence of the ICSID provisions
thereupon: an harmonious reading of Articles 47 and 26 of the ICSID Convention
would easily uphold the rule of exclusivity, but there was no universal consensus upon
the scope of the term “remedy” (i.e., whether it included or not provisional measures).””
Anyway, in reaction to such move, Claimant urged the ICSID tribunal to issue
provisional measures directed at making Respondent abstain from further aggravating

the dispute, thus focusing on its own legal position which was directly affected.

that “lifting the attachment was not justified because, on the one hand, the debt underlying the attachment
was the subject of arbitration proceedings currently pending before ICSID and, on the other hand,
because Art. 26 of the ICSID Convention only excluded recours (the French term) in the sense of legal
proceedings intended to settle the merits f disputes, but not provisional measures such as the attachment
instituted and governed by Swiss law” (4 ICSID Reports, 48 f.).

therefore the authority of the ICSID tribunal, even in the absence of any request from
the opponent party, the tribunal has the power and also the duty to issue de officio
provisional measures pursuant to Art. 39, paragraph 3, of the Arbitration Rules” in
order to restore said integrity.

Any time an arbitral tribunal issues a provisional measures, it has to bear the risk of
being perceived as biased and partial; the more so when it issues de officio measures”
(which explains why they are never issued).*° However, in cases of impact on the
integrity of the arbitral proceedings, said risk is annulled.

In Atlantic Triton Co. v. Guinea,*' Claimant requested attachment of property before
French courts before it started ICSID arbitration. On 12 October 1983, the Commercial
Court of Quimper acceeded to the request, which was later refused on 26 October 1984
by a judgment delivered by the Court of Appeals of Rennes stating that “the clear
purpose and spirit of the Convention, as revealed by the Arbitration Rules, implies that
the arbitral tribunal has the general and exclusive power to rule not only on the merits of
the dispute but also on all provisional measures”.

On 18 November 1986, the Court of Cassation quashed this judgment, underlining that
Art. 26 of the ICSID Convention did not prevent parties from applying to national
courts to seek conservatory measures in order to safeguard the execution of the award.*”
It has to be noted that between the judgment of the Court of Appeals and that of the
Court of Cassation, which alternated exclusive/concurring jurisdiction, the arbitral
tribunal issued its decision whereby ICSID jurisdiction to rule upon provisional

measures should be exclusive.

® Tt reads: “(3) The Tribunal may also recommend provisional measures on its own initiative or
recommend measures other than those specified in a request. It may at any time modify or revoke its
recommendations”. See, e.g., Abaclat and Others v. The Argentine Republic, 1CSID case no. ARB/07/5,
Procedural order no. 11 dated 27 June 2012, para. 20; Convial Callao c. Peru, Decision sobre solicitud de
medidas provisionales fechada 22 Febrero 2011, par. 123.

™ The de officio power/duty is another specific feature of ICSID arbitration, since the rules of
UNCITRAL, ICC, LCIA and SCC only provide for provisional measures requested by one (or more)
parties. In public-international-law adjudication the ICJ, having such attribution, exercised it only once in
its case law; see OELLERS-FRAHM, Article 47, in ZIMMERMANN, TOMUSCHAT, OELLERS-FRAHM [eds.],

Ph.D. Thesis — Federico Lenci

In MINE vy. Guinea,** Claimant had obtained an award from the Arbitration Panel of the
American Arbitration Association (AAA) against Respondent. Further to that, it
requested an attachment of the assets of the Republic of Guinea from the President of
the Court of First Instance of the Canton of Geneva. On 30 May 1985, the President
ordered the attachment of all assets owned by Guinea and held by the Union of Swiss
Banks.** Pending the proceedings before ICSID, respondent filed with the arbitral
tribunal a request for provisional measures directed at causing the suspension of the
attachment proceedings instituted by MINE. Though still adopting the term
“recommend”, the language contained in the decision of the arbitral tribunal is way

more assertive than in Atlantic Triton v. Guinea: indeed, it stated that

“1) The Tribunal recommends that MINE immediately withdraw and permanently discontinue
all pending litigation in national courts, and commence no new action arising out of the dispute
[italics added, A/N]. Litigation based upon the award of the American Arbitration Association is

considered to arise out of this dispute for the purposes of this Provisional Measure.

2) The Tribunal further recommends that MINE dissolve every existing provisional measure
obtained [idem ut supra] in litigation in national courts (including attachment, garnishment,
sequestration, or seizure of the property of Guinea, by whatever term it is designated and by

whatever means obtained) and that MINE seek no new provisional remedy in a national court.

3) Pursuant to Article 47 and the applicable ICSID Regulations and Rules, the Tribunal will

take into account in its award the effects of any non-compliance by MINE with its

; ; 85
recommendations [idem ut supra]”.

Finally, MINE complied with the decision of the ICSID tribunal and caused the

attachment to be withdrawn.*° In that instance, the arbitral tribunal decided to protect

99

the rule of exclusivity by “showing its teeth” through the intimidating formula

contained in point 3;°’ the more so since the expression in its award does not specify
whether the potential monetary sanction would have been limited to the determination
of the costs of the proceedings, or in another aspect of punitive damages.

Confronting the three decisions under comment and keeping the violation of ICSID
jurisdictional exclusivity to rule upon provisional measures, one notes that the first
decision is directed to the State, while the other two are directed to the investor. And yet
the tone whereby the arbitral tribunal protects its authority is significantly different
between these two groups: indeed, it showed much more deference and a cautious
attitude towards the State (in Holiday Inns v. Morocco) which in addition was the first
ICSID case ever, than with regard to the investor. Such a difference may be considered
under the light of the principle of equality of the parties before adjudication organs and
raise concern, since it may be a manifestation of one of the asymmetries deriving from
the mixed character of ICSID arbitration. It is submitted that the difference of treatment
at issue may indeed constitute a problematic point in the relationship between the
arbitral tribunal and national courts — and even more significantly for the parties
between one another and with the arbitral tribunal; nonetheless, said theoretical concern
is reduced today, due to the decrease of such situations in ICSID case law, although

violations of ICSID’s rule of exclusivity are current practice.**

B.II. The principle of concurrent jurisdiction to issue provisional measures in
international (investment as well as commercial) arbitration under the 2010

UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules is enshrined in Art. 26, para. 9, providing that

°7 See SCHREUER, quoted supra footnote 37: “MINE v. Guinea gives unequivocal support to the
protection of ICSID exclusivity vis-d-vis domestic proceedings by way of provisional measures. This is
clear not only from the unambiguous language in which the Tribunal directs MINE to withdraw and
permanently discontinue the domestic proceedings but also from the threat of sanctions and the eventual
award of damages for failure to comply with the Tribunal’s recommendation in a timely fashion”.

Ph.D. Thesis — Federico Lenci

“A request for interim measures addressed by any party to a judicial authority shall not be

deemed incompatible with the agreement to arbitrate, or as a waiver of that agreement”.

How is this provision to be interpreted? Is the principle of concurrent jurisdiction a
mandatory provision of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules? In that case, it could not be
opted out by agreement of the parties. Apparently, this reading could be construed on
the absence in Art. 26 — differently from Art. 47 ICSID Convention — of the expression
“except as the parties otherwise agree”, or similar terms. In addition, since a
characteristic feature of arbitration under the UNCITRAL Rules in comparison to
ICSID arbitration is that provisional measures are enforceable and since the most
effective mechanism in that regard is to request provisional measures directly from the
adjudicatory organ empowered with imperium, opting out of this provision would
render the UNCITRAL system equal to ICSID on this point (a possibility which the
drafters of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules seemingly avoided).””

However, it is submitted that arguments mixing up the issuance of provisional measures
and their enforcement — though worth being considered in certain respects, which have
been addressed — generally generate fallacies. Moreover, since party autonomy is the
cornerstone of international arbitration, in the absence of compelling grounds to the
contrary, treatification and contractualisation of provisional measures can play a
decisive role as /eges speciales; thus, these two sources open the way to the availability
of the contrary principle of exclusive jurisdiction, whose existence State judges shall
verify in order to comply with the obligation entered into by “their” State. At the same
time, negotiating such a clause in the UNCITRAL framework may be risky, since the
arbitral tribunal may be precluded from issuing provisional measures by mandatory
provisions of the lex loci arbitri; in that case, an arbitral tribunal not pertaining to
Gaillard’s third representation, namely that of the ordre juridique arbitral, may feel
itself compelled to abide by said preclusion, to the detriment of the requesting party
which would find itself obstructed.

Be that as it may, this concern shall not be overestimated, since the deferential archaism
of reserving jurisdiction upon provisional measures to local corts is disappearing,
though with notable exceptions.”’

Art. 26, para. 9, is identical to Art. 26, para. 3, of the 1976 version. In providing a
choice to the applicant party, the powers of municipal courts to issue interim measures
supplement those retained by the arbitral tribunal; furthermore, this provision entitles a
broad spectrum of competent State courts, allowing parties to request interim measures
both at the place of the seat of arbitration and elsewhere.”

The topic of exclusive / concurrent jurisdiction is closely related to all other aspects of
provisional measures, in particular with the arbitral tribunal’s legal authority to issue

them, as this phenomenon impinges upon the effectiveness of the whole process.

Ph.D. Thesis — Federico Lenci

Section two: general features of provisional measures in international

investment arbitration

A. Conditions
I. Introduction. — I. Prima facie jurisdiction / Fumus bonae iurisdictionis. — Ill. Urgency. — IV.
Necessity. — V. Prima facie bonum ius / fumus boni iuris. — V1. Link between the provisional

measures requested and the rights in dispute. — VII. Proportionality.

A.I. This section is devoted to the analysis of the general features which characterise
provisional measures in the field at issue, namely their conditions, purposes and
atypicalness.

As far as the first element is concerned, paragraph A will present the conditions for
provisional measures to be granted through the same descriptive tools as those adopted
in the previous chapter in relation to the World Court,” in line with the main thesis
which irrigates the present study. Indeed, Section two constitutes a development of the
second part of the differentiated approach, i.e. comparative assessment of public-
international-law adjudication systems, in order to derive therefrom convergences and
divergences.

Conditions for granting provisional measures are divided into jurisdictional
(Subparagraph IT) and substantial (Subparagraphs III, 1V, V, VI and VII). It has to be
noted that the conditions for provisional measures to be granted constitute a praetorian
construction through consolidation of arbitral case law, since the relevant norms do not
expressly provide for any particular condition, neither in ICSID” nor in arbitration

under the UNCITRAL Rules. No reference is made to the jurisdictional condition.

*? See supra Chapter two, B.ILi., 78 ff.

** See, e.g., Abaclat and Others v. The Argentine Republic, ICSID case no. ARB/07/5, Procedural order
no. 10 on security for costs dated 18 June 2012, 2: “Although Article 47 ICSID Convention and ICSID
Arbitration Rule 39 do not provide for specific requirements for issuing a recommendation of provisional
measures and leaves this largely within the margin of appreciation of the arbitral tribunal, a wide
consensus has emerged in practice according to which a recommendation for provisional measures would
usually require that following conditions be met: (i) urgency of the requested measures, (11) the risk of
irreparable harm or serious prejudice in case the measures are not granted, (111) the necessity of the
measures in order to preserve the right at risk.” This list does not include the jurisdictional condition;
however, as will be discussed below, the arbitral tribunal refrained from addressing said condition, since
the request did otherwise not meet the other conditions.

203
Provisional Measures in International Investment Arbitration
Ph.D. Thesis — Federico Lenci

Moreover, Art. 47 of the ICSID Convention merely refers to the tribunal’s evaluation
whether the circumstances so require, > without mentioning any condition.”° Quite the
same approach can be inferred from the text of Art. 26 of the UNCITRAL Rules,
whereas more indications can be derived therefrom: indeed, urgency and risk of
irreparable harm can be construed on the reference to current or imminent harm which
provisional measures are aimed at preventing pursuant to Art. 26 (2) lett. b, in combined
application with Art. 26 (3) lett. a.””

Furthermore, Art. 26 (3) lett. b requires an additional condition, whose existence shall
be demonstrated by the requesting party, namely the fumus boni iuris of its claim.”* The
difference between ICSID and UNCITRAL in this respect has to be related to the
different perspective concerning enforcement of provisional measures issued by the
arbitral tribunal: the UNCITRAL framework is more strongly oriented in that direction
and therefore — innovating the 1976 Arbitration Rules — the drafters decided to provide
the local judge of enforcement with a clearer guidance with respect to the legality of

these measures.

A.II. Turning to the jurisdictional condition, as we have seen the World Court
developed two different thresholds: 1- the negative perspective, indicating that the

jurisdictional condition will be considered satisfied if it cannot be excluded that the

> In addition, the treaty text does not even provide that the tribunal is compelled to issue provisional
measures if the circumstances so require, since it merely “may” grant them (1.e., allowing wide
discretion); see, e.g., Quiborax v. Bolivia, Decision on provisional measures dated 26 February 2010,
para. 105: “The relevant rules are found in Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID
Arbitration Rules, which are generally considered to grant wide discretion to the Arbitral Tribunal on the
issue of provisional measures”.

°° Even though urgency is not expressly mentioned, it may be construed through two paragraphs of Art.
39 Arbitration Rules, namely para. 2 on the priority which the tribunal shall give to requests for
provisional measures and para. 5 — included in 2006 — on the accelerated procedure for decisions on
provisional measures.

*T Art. 26 (3) lett. a reads: “3. The party requesting an interim measure under paragraphs 2 (a) to (c) shall
satisfy the arbitral tribunal that: (a) Harm not adequately reparable by an award of damages is likely to
result if the measure is not ordered, and such harm substantially outweighs the harm that is likely to result
to the party against whom the measure is directed if the measure is granted”. The same subparagraph
introduces the proportionality analysis between the advantage for the requesting party and the
disadvantage caused to addressee of the provisional measures issued by the arbitral tribunal. The text of
the 2010 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules is available at the UNCITRAL institutional website:
http://www. uncitral.org/uncitral/en/uncitral_ texts/arbitration/2010Arbitration_rules.html.

°8 Art. 26 (3) lett. b. provides that “3. The party requesting an interim measure under paragraphs 2 (a) to
(c) shall satisfy the arbitral tribunal that: [...] (b) There is a reasonable possibility that the requesting
party will succeed on the merits of the claim.”

adjudicating organ has jurisdiction (called here “prima facie jurisdiction’, a low
threshold enshrined in the Anglo-Iranian Oil Co. case) and 2- the positive perspective,
stressing that the jurisdictional condition will be considered met only if there are
elements upon which the organ’s jurisdiction may — or might — be founded (called
“fumus bonae iurisdictionis”’, requiring a higher threshold). The Anglo-Iranian Oil Co.
case constitutes the lowest threshold in the World Court’s case law and at the same time
the most unfortunate, since in that respect the Court later found that it lacked
jurisdiction to deal with the merits of the case. However, quite curiously, this precedent
is very often cited in ICSID cases; what is even more interesting is that it is quoted as a
support, when requesting provisional measures, by Claimants.”

The first logic step on which a decision thereupon has to be construed is constituted by
an ictu oculi assessment on jurisdiction to issue a judgment on the merits of the case.
However, the jurisdictional condition has been gradually developed since the early
ICSID cases, in which it was almost absent: indeed, in Holiday Inns v. Morocco the
tribunal merely referred to the existence of contractual relations between the parties,
construing the jurisdictional condition on their mutual obligation not to frustrate its
execution while arbitral proceedings were pending. '””

In Amco v. Indonesia, another case involving the development of an hotel and its
facilities, Indonesia sought from the arbitral tribunal a decision preventing Claimant
from diffusing information about their dispute in the investment community through
publication in a specialised newspaper, namely Hong Kong’s Business Standard:
according to Respondent, such a publication was aimed at discouraging FDIs in
Indonesia by sheding a negative light on the host State’s conduct with regard to

101

Claimant’s investment." The tribunal found that the article published in the Business

Standard could not have caused any actual harm to Indonesia, nor aggravate or

exacerbate the dispute and consequently declined to issue provisional measures, though

102

it failed to devote a single line on the jurisdictional condition.“ The same approach

” For example, counsel for Claimant in Holiday Inns v. Morocco relied thereupon in order to oppose
potential objections from Respondent to the arbitral tribunal’s jurisdiction to issue provisional measures:

noted that, even though the tribunal felt compelled to investigate upon the existence of
its jurisdiction to issue provisional measures, it construed the latter in terms of power to
pronounce said measures, instead of an ictu oculi assessment upon the existence of its
jurisdiction to rule on the merits of the claim: consequently, this procedural order shall
be considered as pertaining to the first generation of decisions concerning the
jurisdictional condition (i.e., absent or light jurisdictional condition).''°

Other cases, in particular those instituted since the baby-boom of international
investment arbitration at the beginning of the XXI century, express the arbitral
tribunals’ concern not to grant provisional measures without first investigating, at least
prima facie, upon their jurisdiction to deal with the merits of the case. They have
proceeded in this direction even in the absence of party’s disagreement thereupon, L.e.
on a de officio basis.'""

In a famous case, the arbitral tribunal, consistently with the parties’ intentions, ruled
definitively on its jurisdiction before resolving the issue of provisional measures:

The SGS vy. Pakistan case''® constitute a development in this connection. Since
Respondent had instituted parallel proceedings before the courts of Pakistan whose
subject-matter related to arbitration and in addition an Islamabad-based arbitration was
pending between the parties on the relevant contract claims, Claimant requested the
arbitral tribunal to recommend that Respondent withdraw and cause to be discontinued
the former, stay the latter and take no action that might aggravate or further extend the

dispute submitted to the Tribunal.!’”

Due to the urgency of a decision in that regard, the
arbitral tribunal decided to grant the measures requested without prejudice to the
consideration of Pakistan’s objections to its jurisdiction: indeed, it found that it had
prima facie jurisdiction pointing to SGS’s prima facie right to settle the dispute pending
before it through application of the arbitration agreement contained in the applicable
BIT.

jurisdictional condition).''”

Development Co. (Private) Limited v. Republic of Zimbabwe,'”' the tribunals denied the
measures requested by Claimants,'’” but nonetheless issued — in the form of a halfway
between recommendatory and binding measures, by stating that they strongly
encourage both parties — measures aimed at avoiding further aggravation of the dispute

and protecting the proceedings.”

A.IM. Urgency is the first substantial condition under examination. As anticipated,
although it is not expressly mentioned in Art. 47 ICSID Convention nor in Art. 39
ICSID Arbitration Rules, it may be construed through two paragraphs of the latter
article, namely paragraph 2 on the priority which the tribunal shall give to requests for
provisional measures and paragraph 5 — included in 2006 — on the accelerated procedure
for decisions on provisional measures. This condition is an intrinsic feature of
provisional measures, which are granted — where appropriate — precisely because the
situation can not await the outcome of the award, on jurisdiction or on the merits.
Furthermore, where procedural integrity of the proceedings are at stake, the tribunal
does not need to assess the existence of urgency, which is in re ipsa: indeed, in
Quiborax v. Bolivia, the arbitral tribunal found that “if measures are intended to protect
the procedural integrity of the arbitration, in particular with respect to access to or
integrity of the evidence, they are urgent by definition” .'**

This condition may play a role in the form adopted by the arbitral tribunal when
granting a provisional measure, since orders generally require more time for their

issuance than interim awards.!”

Provisional Measures in International Investment Arbitration
Ph.D. Thesis — Federico Lenci

In cases of particular urgency, Art. 16, paragraph 2, ICSID Arbitration Rules provides
that the arbitral tribunal may grant provisional measures through the exchange of
correspondence among the members of the panel, provided that all of them are
consulted.'”° Such an extreme measure, however, will arguably be adopted when all
other conditions are seemingly met, since otherwise the very need to have recourse
thereto would be fictional.

In any manner, Art. 39, para. 4, requires that the principle of contradictoire has to be
respected: ex parte measures are prohibited in ICSID arbitration, contrary to arbitration
under the UNCITRAL Rules. However, in Bernhard von Pezold and Others v.

; 127
Zimbabwe,

the President of the competent ICSID tribunal decided to issue a pre-
provisional measure under the form of “directions” without consulting his co-
arbitrators'** and in the absence of contradictoire,'’’ due to the extreme urgency to
preserve disclosure of evidence.'*’ The need to protect evidence is particularly relevant
and the correspondent level of urgency depends on the type of measure requested and
on its purpose. ’>

Since the specific circumstances characterising the existence of urgency in the dispute
before the arbitral tribunal are drawn on a case-by-case basis, it 1s deemed more
appropriate to focus on the negative perspective, namely the circumstances excluding
urgency. In this regard, a close relationship exists between this condition and the
concept of irreparable harm, thus connecting urgency with necessity.

In Plama v. Bulgaria, the tribunal ruled that the need for provisional measures shall be

urgent and necessary to preserve the status quo or to avoid irreparable damage.'*? In

order and not an interim award, given the urgency required for such decision, the Tribunal may decide
(upon its own initiative or any Party’s request) to confirm such order at a later date in the form of an
interim award under Articles 26 and 32 of the UNCITRAL Rules, without the Tribunal hereby intending
conclusively to determine the status of this decision, one way or the other, as an award under the 1958

that case, it found that both conditions were lacking, since the tribunal’s capacity to
issue an award on monetary damages would not be affected by the pending parallel
proceedings in Bulgaria, whose suspension Claimant had requested in its request for
provisional measures.!*°

Moreover, if additional harm can be restored by awarding additional damages, such an
harm is not irreparable and therefore the condition of urgency is not satisfied.
Furthermore, such an irreparable harm shall at the same time be imminent, since
otherwise provisional measures would not be justified.'**

This approach has been followed in ad hoc proceedings conducted under the
UNCITRAL Rules: in Sergei Paushok v. Mongolia, the arbitral tribunal ruled that
monetary compensation is always sufficient to preclude the requesting party from

os . . . 135
obtaining interim measures of protection.

A.IV. For a request of provisional measures to be legitimate under the substantive
grounds — though not automatically granted — the condition of necessity shall also be
satisfied. Both urgency and necessity are included under the broader term periculum in

given provisional measure is not urgent, therefore it is not necessary. However, the two
conditions are so closely interrelated, that in some instances they are melt together in

about the concept that the possibility of monetary compensation is always sufficient to bar any request for
interim measures under the [1976] UNCITRAL Rules. But those specific features point not only to the

Provisional Measures in International Investment Arbitration
Ph.D. Thesis — Federico Lenci

The concept of irreparable prejudice derives from the case law of the ICJ: provisional
measures are necessary when the actions of a party “are capable of causing or of
threatening irreparable prejudice to the rights invoked”.'*’ Said irreparable prejudice,”
which gives content to the general chapeau of necessity, has in certain cases be applied
also with regard to monetary damage, theoretically likely to be restored through

compensation in the award:'*! indeed, in Saipem v. Bangladesh the Tribunal found that

“In view of the pending litigation in Bangladesh, the Tribunal considers that there 1s both
necessity and urgency. This finding is reinforced by the facts that [...] there is a risk of

irreparable harm if Saipem has to pay the amount of the Warranty Bond”.'”

Commenting these lines, Roland Ziadé has argued that the arbitral tribunal adopted a
milder approach upon the concept at issue, more similar to the relevant case law in
international commercial arbitration.'*”

In Cemex v. Venezuela, the arbitral tribunal significantly contributed to the development
of the concept of irreparable prejudice. First of all, it identified two categories of cases
on the issue within the ICSID framework, namely Plama vy. Bulgaria (“harm is not

144

irreparable if it can be compensated for by damages”)'™ and Burlington v. Ecuador

(“the risk here is the destruction of an ongoing investment”).'*°

Secondly, it acknowledged that the distinction between situations where the alleged
prejudice can be readily compensated by an award granting damages'*° and those where
there is a serious risk of destruction of an ongoing investment should have a bearing
upon the test of irreparable harm; finally, it ruled that in the second category, which
satisfies the Burlington threshold, the condition of necessity is satisfied.'*”

The idea that monetary compensation does not automatically eliminate the possible
need for interim measures has also been advanced in case law under the UNCITRAL
Rules.'*®

Another element which lies under the general chapeau of necessity is proportionality,

which will be presented in the appropriate subparagraph.”

A.V. The third substantial condition consists in the standard to be met upon the
existence of rights whose identification and protection is sought through arbitration
proceedings.

Since the tribunal is called to rule thereupon on a necessarily urgent and temporary
basis — subject to modification and revocation — this assessment has to be made ictu
oculi; in this sense, it bears resemblance with the type of scrutiny made when
addressing the jurisdictional condition.

Quite needless to say, neither ICSID nor UNCITRAL provisions refer to this condition
and the threshold which shall be met for it to be considered satisfied; thus, one has to
turn to case law. After reviewing it, it is possible to note that the thresholds vary in

intensity, from the establishment of a prima facie case that the legally protected interest

150 151

exists ~~ to the prima facie existence of the right’-° and the strongly arguable case that

the right exists.'°* In any manner, they are always set forth from a positive perspective
(fumus boni iuris).

Other conditions, in particular that of necessity, may influence the degree required by
the tribunal before considering that fumus boni iuris exists in the case before it: a
suggestion in that direction is provided by the Occidental Petroleum v. Ecuador case,
where the tribunal, after denying that such fumus was demonstrated by the requesting
party, added that any prejudice suffered, “if subsequently found illegal by the tribunal,
can be readily compensated by a monetary award”.'”°

Considering the high threshold adopted in that case and the subsequent finding about

monetary compensation, it is argued that a higher risk of prejudice, such as that of the

Burlington test, is able to lower the fumus boni iuris threshold.

A.VI. Art. 39, para. 1, ICSID Arbitration Rules provides that the requesting party shall
specify, inter alia, the rights to be preserved. Shall they necessarily coincide with the
rights in dispute?

The link between the provisional measure requested and the rights in dispute can be
considered a condition contained in the broader chapeau of that of necessity: indeed, the
effectiveness of provisional measures may be considered to be depending on the
relationship — or even coincidence — between it and the rights which are controverted
before the tribunal.

In this regard, two tendencies have arisen in ICSID case law; they will be discussed in
more detail in the subparagraph devoted to the analysis of the purpose of preserving the

parties’ rights.’>*

In brief, one tendency considers that these two elements, namely
object of the request for provisional measures and rights in dispute, shall coincide
(Maffezini test), whereas the other one provides that they must relate, though not
necessarily coincide (Plama test).

For the reasons set forth below, arbitral tribunals will be well advised to follow the
Plama test, which best corresponds to the other conditions and purposes of provisional

measures.

A.VII. Proportionality, as well, is related to necessity: in Quiborax v. Bolivia, the

arbitral tribunal found that

“Claimants have accurately pointed out that the necessity requirement requires the Tribunal to
consider the proportionality of the requested provisional measures. The Tribunal must thus
balance the harm caused to Claimants by the criminal proceedings and the harm that would be

caused to Respondent if the proceedings were stayed or terminated”.'”

This criterion is codified in Art. 17A UNCITRAL Model Law: according to such

156

standard, adopted to an increasing extent in both ICSID™~” and arbitration under the

UNCITRAL Rules,'”’ the requesting party shall demonstrate that:

“Harm not adequately repaired by an award of damages is likely to result if the measure is not
ordered, and such harm substantially outweighs the harm that is likely to result to the party

. . . . . 158
against whom the measure is directed if the measure is granted”.

It can quite readily be noted that the first part of the provision (“harm not adequately
repaired by an award of damages”) refers to the condition of necessity in a rather
peculiar form, a sort of halfway between the Plama v. Bulgaria (“harm is not
irreparable if it can be compensated for by damages”) and Burlington v. Ecuador (“the
risk here is the destruction of an ongoing investment”) tests; accordingly, the
proportionality test will not be applied in every case and, moreover, such a scrutiny will
be carried out after verifying that the condition of necessity is satisfied.

Proportionality analysis as a condition for assessing the opportunity to issue provisional
measures — not limited to the international investment arbitration area — rose to
prominence thanks to the works of Richard Posner in the academia and as a judge

appointed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in Chicago. One of the

main theorists in the field of economic analysis of the law, he was a leader of the so-
called Chicago School of antitrust theory. In a 1986 case, American Hospital Supply
Corp. v. Hospital Products Limited, he elaborated a formula for determining when

preliminary injunctions should be granted:

“If the harm to the plaintiff if the injunction is denied, multiplied by the probability that the
plaintiff will win at trial, exceeds the harm to the defendant if the injunction is granted,

multiplied by the probability that granting the injunction would be an error, preliminary

injunctions should be granted”.!””

He extended this formula to any type of provisional measures. Although his view may
be criticised on two grounds, namely because it reduces complexities of relations
between the parties to mere mathematical products and because the notion of error
seems excessively broad for a mathematical formula,'®’ it nonetheless has the great
merit of including the variable of fumus boni iuris: indeed, provisional measures are
harmful, therefore understandably they shall not unduly burden one of the parties.
Moreover, provisional measures which burden Repondent — out of any deferential
discourse — have to be handled with particular care, since it is Claimant who stirs its
opponent’s legal sphere.

In conclusion, the question whether this criterion shall be applied in international
investment arbitration may be answered in the affirmative, not merely because of its
establishment in the UNCITRAL Model Law — which is not a binding document, but a
collection of fine arbitral practice — but rather as an instrument comprised in the

inherent power of the arbitral tribunal.'°’

'° U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, American Hospital Supply Corp. v. Hospital Products

Limited, 780 F.2d, 1986, 589.

'® Indeed, considering the “dark side” of fumus boni iuris, namely the probability that the claim will be
rejected — leaving the appropriate space for undetermination — seems to be more appropriate, inasmuch
one decides to stick to mathematical formulas, an apparently hazardous approach.

'S! As a consequence, its discretionary application is even more increased.

B. Purposes
I. Introduction. — II. Preserving the parties’ rights. — III. Securing discovery of evidence. — IV.

Preventing self-help. — V. Safeguarding the enforcement of the award.

B.I. The general purpose of provisional measures is to facilitate both the development
and the result of the adjudication process.”

The specific purposes of provisional measures are directly related to the conditions for
granting them: indeed, both are fundamental indicators for the adjudicating organ of
their propriety in that specific case and — in particular — in that specific moment.
However, short of reducing the relevance of their role, it has to be noted nonetheless
that they are mere indicators, not binding legal grounds, for their granting, due to the
evidence that the arbitral tribunal has a discretionary power in this respect (Art. 47
ICSID Convention provides that it may recommend provisional measures).

The only purpose of provisional measures expressis verbis contained in the treaty texts
is the first one analysed in this subparagraph, namely the preservation of the parties’

rights: under the aforementioned Art. 47

“Except as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal may, if it considers that the circumstances
SO require, recommend any provisional measures which should be taken to preserve the
respective rights of either party” [italics added, in order to indicate the finality of these

measures under the terms of the ICSID Convention].

In addition, according to Art. 39, para. 1,'° of ICSID Arbitration Rules, the requesting
party shall specify:

'© See SCHREUER, quoted supra footnote 37, 759: “The purpose of provisional measures is to induce

behaviour by the parties that is conducive to a successful outcome of the proceedings such as securing
discovery of evidence, preserving the parties’ rights, preventing self-help, safeguarding the awards’
eventual implementation and generally keeping the peace. They have to be taken at a time when the
outcome of a dispute is still uncertain. Therefore, the Tribunal has to strike a careful balance between the
urgency of a request for provisional measures and the need not to preyudge the merits of the case”
[footnote omitted, A’/N]. The commentator of the second edition notes that the Tribunal in Biwater Gauff
v. Tanzania, Procedural order no. | dated 31 March 2006, para. 67, quoted the referred passage from the
first edition of the Commentary. My analysis of the purposes adopts this representation as a starting point.
For a wording similar to that of Schreuer’s Commentary see also Churchill Mining PLC v. Republic of
Indonesia, 1CSID case no. ARB/12/14, Procedural order no. 3 on provisional measures dated 4 March
2013, para. 19.

1- the rights to be preserved;
2- the measures the recommendation of which is requested; and

3- the circumstances that require such measures.

Even though Art. 39, para. 3, provides that provisional measures can be issued proprio
motu, practice has shown that they are always requested on the initiative of the

interested party.’

In this connection, the requesting party bears the burden of proving
both the purpose of provisional measures (point | above) and the conditions’®’ on which
the request lies (point 3).'°° The existence of such conditions, also called circumstances
in Art. 47 ICSID Convention and Art. 39, para. 1, ICSID Arbitration Rules, is verified

by the arbitral tribunal.'°”

In this exercise, the arbitral tribunal can take advantage of the
additional tool of verifying whether the measures requested (point 2) are appropriate so
as to achieve the alleged purpose (the preservation of rights, i.e. point 1) under the
alleged conditions (point 3) of the specific case in that specific moment. Thus, the
interplay between the three points in this triangular verification demonstrates the

necessity of each point with one another. In such interrelatedness, given the power of

'®3 Art. 39 ICSID Arbitration Rules contains paragraphs providing for both substantial (paras. 1 and 3)
and procedural (paras. 2, 4, 5 and 6) elements concerning provisional measures: “(1) At any time after the
institution of the proceeding, a party may request that provisional measures for the preservation of its
rights be recommended by the Tribunal. The request shall specify the rights to be preserved, the measures
the recommendation of which is requested, and the circumstances that require such measures. (2) The
Tribunal shall give priority to the consideration of a request made pursuant to paragraph (1). (3) The
Tribunal may also recommend provisional measures on its own initiative or recommend measures other
than those specified in a request. It may at any time modify or revoke its recommendations. (4) The
Tribunal shall only recommend provisional measures, or modify or revoke its recommendations, after
giving each party an opportunity of presenting its observations. (5) If a party makes a request pursuant to
paragraph (1) before the constitution of the Tribunal, the Secretary-General shall, on the application of
either party, fix time limits for the parties to present observations on the request, so that the request and
observations may be considered by the Tribunal promptly upon its constitution. (6) Nothing in this Rule
shall prevent the parties, provided that they have so stipulated in the agreement recording their consent,
from requesting any judicial or other authority to order provisional measures, prior to or after the
institution of the proceeding, for the preservation of their respective rights and interests”.

This paragraph on the purposes of provisional measures focuses on their substantial elements.

164 This aspect had already been indicated by SCHREUER quoted supra footnote 37, 762.

'® Discussed supra, paragraph A.

'°6 Tn Maffezini v. Spain, para. 10, the arbitral tribunal generally stated that the requesting party “has the
burden to demonstrate why the Tribunal should grant its application”; see also Saipem v. Bangladesh,

the arbitral tribunal to issue provisional measures other than those requested, '°* from the
applicant’s perspective point 2 is less relevant than points | and 3.

The purposes are so directly related with the conditions, that, to a certain extent, they
may be considered as a further condition to be tested by the arbitral tribunal before
granting provisional measures: if the purpose is not legitimate, the measure will not be
granted. In particular, the purpose shall satisfy the tests of urgency, necessity and risk of
irreparable harm, 1.e. the conditions included under the broader term periculum in mora.
Therefore, conditions and purposes are dealt with separately only for didactic purposes,
bearing in mind said features.

There may be various rationales for the opportunity to evaluate the purposes of
provisional measures: among others, assessment of the legitimacy of the request, easing
the tribunal’s task to issue measures other than those requested (if need be), evaluating
whether the issued measures are no longer needed and thus complying with their
temporary nature, since under Arbitration Rule 39, para. 3, the arbitral tribunal may at

‘© Using Ockham’s razor, the simplest explanation is

any time modify or revoke them.
that purposes constitute a useful tool in order to assess the legitimacy of the request;

however, minor rationales are applicable as well.

B.II. The first purpose, namely that of preserving the parties’ rights, is the only one that
is mentioned in the treaty texts. It constitutes a broad chapeau under which all the other
purposes can be covered: indeed, since it is not specified whether the parties’ rights at
issue are substantial or procedural, both are included in the provision.

The substantial element covers the safeguard of the enforcement of the award
(protecting the right to property, during the proceeding and thereafter), whereas the
procedural element covers the right to evidence and — more broadly — to a fair

adjudication (securing discovery of evidence'’’ and preventing self-help). For the sake

'® See e.g. Tokios Tokeles v. Ukraine, Procedural order no. 1 dated 1 July 2003, para.5.

'” Securing discovery of evidence shall be distinguished from orders of production of evidence: while the
former is protected under Art. 47 ICSID Convention (since it is a provisional measure), the latter is
provided for by Art. 43 ICSID Convention. For the application of such distinction in ICSID case law see
Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania, \CSID case no. ARB/05/22, Procedural order no. 1 dated 31 March 2006. For

of completeness, another overwhelming purpose has to be mentioned, namely that of
protecting the right to integrity of the proceedings under Art. 26 ICSID Convention,
pursuant to the rule of exclusivity of ICSID proceedings discussed above.'’’ The
provisional measure aimed at avoiding parallel proceedings is generally an order or
recommendation to suspend, discontinue (or cause to be discontinued) non-ICSID
proceedings.”

Furthermore, a point which has to be clarified consists in the nature of the rights which
provisional measures aim at preserving, under the terms of Art. 47 ICSID Convention
and Art. 39, para. 1, ICSID Arbitration Rules. This issue was addressed for the first time
in ICSID history in Amco Asia v. Indonesia: the arbitral tribunal found that the rights
referred to in those provisions have to be circumscribed within the rights in dispute.'”
While agreeing with the arbitral tribunal’s rationale for such limitation, the Plama v.

Bulgaria tribunal innovated in this respect, extending the breadth of requests for

provisional measures to the rights relating to the dispute.”

rights a party may have unconnected with the ECT or vis-a-vis third parties. If the words used in Amco
Asia, “rights in dispute”, may be too narrow, at least a limitation such as “rights relating to the dispute” is
reasonable and necessary. The rights to be preserved must relate to the requesting party’s ability to have
its claims and requests for relief in the arbitration fairly considered and decided by the arbitral tribunal
and for any arbitral decision which grants to the Claimant the relief it seeks to be effective and able to be
carried out”. In the same sense, quoting part of the passage above, Churchill Mining v. Indonesia, pata.

Ph.D. Thesis — Federico Lenci

The reason for limiting the rights whose protection can be afforded by provisional
measures is readily understandable: admitting protection for any sort of right, even
unrelated with the dispute, would generate a distortion of this procedural mechanism
and of the respective legal conditions of the parties between each other and before the
arbitral tribunal. It is argued that the latter interpretation is the only one which is correct,
while that purported in Amco Asia shall not be followed,'” for two reasons which the

Plama y. Bulgaria did not explain.'”°

Firstly, referring to mere rights in dispute would
unduly exclude the application of security for costs,'’’ whose purpose is to safeguard
the enforcement of the award.'” As a matter of fact, Respondent may suffer a prejudice
when Claimant’s case is manifestly groundless: the scrutiny carried out by the
Secretary-General when a request for arbitration is filed with the ICSID Centre is
limited — and rightly so — to a verification of non-manifest lack of jurisdiction of the
Centre (i.e., there is no evaluation of the merits of the case).'” Therefore, the potential
institution of completely groundless arbitration proceedings can not — and shall not — be

excluded: security for costs are there precisely to avoid the risks of non-coverage of

' See, contra, Churchill Mining v. Indonesia, paras. 49-50. However, it is submitted that the impact of
the interpretation made by the arbitral tribunal in this case shall not be overestimated, due to the close
resemblance that this case bore with Amco v. Indonesia (acknowledged by the tribunal itself). Moreover,
the alleged rights to be protected were extremely generic and, as a consequence, weak. Finally, the
arbitral tribunal found — at para. 50 — that those rights “are not rights in dispute that could warrant the
recommendation of provisional measures”, therefore implicitly confirming that the mere fact that the
alleged rights are not in dispute can not suffice for a request to be rejected.

'7° Nor did the Churchill Mining v. Indonesia arbitral tribunal.

'” Indeed, in Maffezini v. Spain, paras. 24 f., the arbitral tribunal incredibly denied Respondent’s request
for security for costs under the following ground: “24. In this case, the subject matter in dispute relates to
an investment in Spain by an Argentine investor while the request for provisional measures relates to a
guarantee or bond to ensure payment of additional costs and expenses should the Claimant not prevail in
the case. 25. It is clear that these are two separate issues. The issue of provisional measures is unrelated
to the facts of the dispute before the Tribunal” [italics added, A/N]. However, a few lines above, at para.
23, it had stated that “Any preliminary measure to be ordered by an ICSID arbitral tribunal must relate to
the subject matter of the case before the tribunal and not to separate, unrelated issues or extraneous
matters” [italics added]. The tribunal apparently falls in contradiction, because it firstly asserts that a
request for provisional measures must relate to the subject matter of the dispute (which security for costs
undoubtedly do) and then states that the issue of provisional measures is unrelated to the facts of the
dispute (which may be true, but certainly is something different that what had been set out before as a
condition). It is not a clerical error, since upon this point the tribunal dismissed Respondent’s application;
it can tentatively be argued that it is highly probable that the tribunal had already decided not to grant the
request due to the hypothetical situations on which it was based (see para. 16), however the surprising
result which shall not be followed remains.

"8 See below, Section two, B.V.

'® Art. 36, para. 3, ICSID Convention reads: “The Secretary-General shall register the request unless he
finds, on the basis of the information contained in the request, that the dispute is manifestly outside the
jurisdiction of the Centre. He shall forthwith notify the parties of registration or refusal to register”.

costs when arbitration is concluded in favour of Respondent and Claimant is
impecunious. This right to property does not constitute a right in dispute, but
nonetheless it deserves protection by way of provisional measures: therefore, the
analysis of the purposes of provisional measures contributes to a better understanding
and a correct interpretation of their scope.

Secondly, there is a reason which derives — in the perspective of mere logic — from the
text of Art. 39, para. 1, ICSID Arbitration Rules, where it provides that the requesting
party has to specify the rights to be preserved:'* had such rights to be exclusively those
in dispute, there would be no need to specify them; accordingly, adopting the effet utile
criterion of interpretation,'*' we are able to reach the conclusion that the rights to be
preserved through provisional measures shall not necessarily coincide with the rights in

dispute.

B.II. The category of protected rights is not limited, as we have seen, to the mere

evidence are essential conditions of fair adjudication and due process.

In Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania, Respondent carried out a seizure of Claimant’s assets,
occupying its offices and taking over the whole business, allegedly performing an
unlawful expropriation for which Claimant asked compensation and reparation of
damages before ICSID.'* In its request for arbitration, Claimant also formulated a
request for provisional measures in relation to payments of certain sums and to
preservation of records and other relevant documents pending the determination of the
arbitral tribunal. In a nutshell, Claimant maintained that the seizure of its property had
made it impossible for it to assess and demonstrate in detail the character of the

expropriation it had suffered and therefore to pursue its claim in the arbitral proceeding;

in addition, it considered those documents to be at risk of loss or destruction if left in

the possession of the party whose economic interest was at stake due to their
existence. '**

The facts of the case were analogous with two of the most renowned early precedents of
ICSID, namely Agip v. Congo'® and Vacuum Salt v. Ghana.'*° In this respect, the
purpose of the request for provisional measures was that of preserving its procedural
right to evidence and therefore to a fair adjudication of its claims, to which the arbitral

meaning that not all sort of evidence deserves protection by way of provisional
measures, even if it may be pertinent to the case at stake: accordingly, Claimant’s
request for an inventory of documents under the availability of Respondent was
partially amended because it lacked specificity and therefore was excessively
burdensome to the latter; the arbitral tribunal referred the parties to a scheme of mutual
cooperation with the aim of identifying the relevant documents to be inserted in the
inventory. **

In any event, the tribunal’s most significant contribution to the precise identification of
the procedural rights at issue consists in the demarcation of the dividing line between

Art. 47 (provisional measures) and Art. 43 (production of documents) of the ICSID
Convention. Art. 43 reads:

“Except as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal may, if it deems it necessary at any stage of
the proceedings,

(a) call upon the parties to produce documents or other evidence, and

'8” Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania, para. 86: “In the Arbitral Tribunal’s view, BGT’s request that this evidence
be preserved is reasonable. Until a view can be taken as to the relevance and materiality of such evidence,
the safest course at this early stage of the proceedings is to ensure that no adverse step is taken in relation
to the same. To this extent, BGT has clearly identified the right which it seeks to preserve by means of the
requested provisional measures. It has also identified the measures the recommendation of which is
requested. The Arbitral Tribunal also considers that the requirements of necessity and urgency are met,
the former because of the potential need for the evidence in question, and the latter because there is a
need for such evidence to be preserved before the proceedings progress any further (e.g. to enable each
party properly to plead their respective cases)”. On the test of reasonableness, see also, ex multis,

(b) visit the scene connected with the dispute, and conduct such inquiries there as it may deem

appropriate”.

In the management of documents pending proceedings, two different purposes may be
achieved under the Convention, namely preservation and production. In the tribunal’s
provisional view,'*”’ Art. 47 is designed to ensure preservation, whereas Art. 43 provides
for production.’’’ According to such decision, it will be relevant to draw on the specific
purpose aimed at by the applicant before granting provisional protection under Art. 47
of the Convention.

Said precedent regarding the dividing line between preservation and production was
taken into account by Claimant in Railroad Development Corporation v. Republic of
Guatemala,'”' in which it made a request under Art. 47 — and Art. 10.20.8 of
CAFTA,” being that treaty applicable in the case — only in relation to the former
purpose. Incidentally, it is worth noting in this vein that this distinction plays an
additional role: the persuasiveness of the 2010 IBA Rules on the taking of evidence’”’ is
higher as to production — to which they are related — than to preservation of
documents.’”*

In Abaclat and Others v. The Argentine Republic, the arbitral tribunal acceded to

Respondent’s request whereby Claimant had to refrain from deleting and/or destroying

'8° Thid., para. 101.

'%° Tbid., para. 100: “This is a more controversial issue [i.e., production of documents, A/N] when framed
as an application for provisional measures under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention. Actual production
is not usually considered within the ambit of such interim relief, partly because preservation is usually
sufficient to protect the nghts in question, and partly because actual production is catered for by other
tules (in particular Article 43 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 34 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules).
Indeed, the two procedures are aimed at different issues: Article 47 is designed to ensure that the Arbitral
Tribunal can properly discharge its mandate, whilst Article 43 is one element in a range of provisions that
structures how the mandate is to be discharged”.

'! See for the reference to the case supra footnote 117.

' Art. 10.20.8 of CAFTA provides in relevant part: “A tribunal may order an interim measure of
protection to preserve the rights of a disputing party, or to ensure that the tribunal’s jurisdiction is made
fully effective, including an order to preserve evidence in the possession or control of a disputing party or
to protect the tribunal’s jurisdiction”.

' The 2010 IBA Rules on the taking of evidence were adopted by IBA Council resolution dated 29 May
2010. For the text of the rules see IBA’s official website: http://www.ibanet.org.

' As correctly pointed out by the arbitral tribunal at para. 32, “the IBA Rules are used widely by
international arbitral tribunals as a guide even when not binding upon them. Precedents and informal
documents, such as the IBA Rules, reflect the experience of recognized professionals in the field and
draw their strenght from their intrinsic merit and persuasive value rather than from their binding
character”; see also para. 20.

any document relating to Claimants having allegedly withdrawn from the proceedings
under two purposes: preserving Respondent’s right of defense and ensuring the integrity

the latter — as we have seen — being an element characterising

of the proceedings,
both the interests of the parties and the authority of the arbitral tribunal.

Concluding on the purpose of preservation of evidence, it is deemed relevant to briefly
sketch a peculiar case of pre-provisional measures issued under the term of directions in
the Bernhard von Pezold and Others v. Zimbabwe case:'”° since Respondent had
allegedly intimidated Claimants ordering a documents disclosure regime in violation of
the one ordered by the arbitral tribunal at the joint first session, the President of the
arbitral tribunal issued an interim order directing that Respondent refrain from such
actions, with the purpose in this case of preserving the documents disclosure regime.'”’
This unprecedented decision, made solely by the President and derogating from the
principle of contradictoire provided for by Art. 39, para. 4 ICSID Convention, indicates

the unavoidable preminence of the preservation of documents for fair arbitration

proceedings.

B.IV. The purpose of preventing self-help is quite often referred to in cases of
publications or any other form of communications to the media carried out by Claimant
while proceedings are pending, in order to harm the host State. In this light, it 1s
addressed in contrast with right to confidentiality of arbitration. However, since
confidentiality is rapidly eroding — at least in ICSID arbitration — usually this kind of
requests are denied in limine, even before evaluating their urgency and necessity. As a
consequence, this stream of ICSID case law and the purpose of preventing self-help are
relatively unknown, though there are instances of other types of application deserving
being mentioned.

In Churchill Mining PLC v. Republic of Indonesia, Respondent requested, inter alia,

“that the tribunal order Claimant to refrain from making false, unfounded and

misleading statements in the media regarding the case at hand”.'’* The dispute had
originated from the alleged revocation of mining licenses by Respondent. According to
Indonesia, Claimant’s conduct in the press was depicting the host State as an
unfavourable scene for foreign direct investments with the additional aim of exerting
pressure and gaining a negotiation tool in that regard: accordingly, the purpose for its
request of provisional measures was that of preventing self-help.'”’ In its response,
Claimant relied on Amco v. Indonesia,’ World Duty Free v. Kenya’®' and EDF vy.
Romania’” as evidence of a tendency contrary to the alleged right to confidentiality.
The arbitral tribunal, after recalling that in Amco v. Indonesia the issues were similar,
since Indonesia complained of various newspaper articles that it considered harmful,
found that the ICSID framework did not impose confidentiality and that the alleged
“right to attract foreign investment” and analogous formulations made by Respondent
were not rights in dispute worth of recommendation for provisional measures.”°° Thus,
in the case under comment the arbitral tribunal ruled that the applicant had failed to
qualify the right that may justify provisional measures, without the need to investigate
the conditions urgency and necessity (which however were evaluated for the sake of
completeness and deemed to be absent);”” it nevertheless upheld the validity of the
purpose of preventing self-help.

In a different context, Bernhard von Pezold and Others v. Republic of Zimbabwe,
Claimants requested provisional measures with the purpose of preventing self-help, due

to the intimidating conduct carried out by agents for Respondent who entered

Claimants’ property without authorisation.*” Claimants requested that the arbitral

tribunals

“Order the Respondent to instruct its police to prevent people from coming onto the Makandi

Estate, and to the extent that those people have already arrived on the Makandi Estate, to

remove them, unless those people are authorised by the Claimants”.””°

Having Respondent undertaken to ensure the maintainance of the status quo and that the
police would protect Claimants upon any reports received, the arbitral tribunal decided
to dismiss Claimants’ application for failure to demonstrate the basis for provisional
measures.-’’ In this case as well, it nonetheless upheld the validity of the purpose of

preventing self-help.”

B.V. The purpose of safeguarding the enforcement of the award constitutes a genus, of
which security for costs is a species: indeed, the latter aims at securing the potential
enforcement of the award in favour of Respondent against a losing impecunious
Claimant. However, there is no parallelism in favour of Claimant in arbitral case law at
the provisional measures stage, for a series of reasons: first of all, due to the
presumption against the probability that the State will be unable to honour the award (a
presumption which should be reconsidered, in the face of current practice); secondly,
and perhaps more importantly, due to a persistent mindset among the majority of
investment arbitrators whereby deference towards the State shall be paid to the largest
possible extent. Of course, the necessity of deference is admittedly essential for the very
practicality of mixed dispute settlement mechanisms; at the same time, concerns
regarding equality of arms in international adjudication and the opportunity to reduce its

asymmetries warrant new assessment. In consideration of the present vacuum, at this

I. Introduction. — II. Measures for the protection of the tribunal’s jurisdiction. — III. Measures
aimed at preventing aggravation or exacerbation of the dispute. — IV. Preservation of evidence.

— V. Security for costs.

C.I. The third part of this section is devoted to the presentation of a relevant feature of
provisional measures, namely their atypicalness. Art. 47 ICSID Convention provides
that the arbitral tribunal may issue any provisional measure it deems appropriate,
considering the specific case and the specific moment at hand.”'” This adds to other
features which render this procedural mechanism so fascinating and flexible: there is no
standard moment when a decision on provisional measures shall be made; there is no
standard party entitled to originate a decision thereupon; nothing prevents the parties
from reiterating the very same request, taking account of a modification occurred while
the proceedings were pending; it is only in part a decision, since it does not bind the
arbitral tribunal (empowered to modify or revoke it) nor is it conducive to a pre-
judgment on the merits of the case.

As we have already seen, provisional measures vary and are tailored to the specific case
for which they apply, therefore the vital element of their atypicalness shall be
maintained, avoiding crystallisations. This being said, it is nonetheless deemed useful to
advance further with the analysis of how provisional measures have been applied in
order to draw indications from arbitral practice: short of categorising, this part aims at
illustrating analogies in terms of type of case and correlated type of measures: the more
parallelisms appear, the more useful the research in this sense will be.

Atypicalness is related to purposes: different purposes require different measures, as we
will see below. In addition, it is deemed relevant to note how standard conditions are
considered at different degrees due to different purposes and the atypicalness of

provisional measures.

*!° See RSM v. Saint Lucia, Decision on Saint Lucia’s request for security for costs dated 13 August 2014,
para. 51: “Neither Article 47 ICSID Convention nor ICSID Arbitration Rule 39 deals with the tribunal’s
power to order security for costs explicitly. The type of provisional measures a tribunal may recommend
is not specified in those provisions”.

C.II. The need to protect the arbitral tribunal’s jurisdiction is fundamental. It comprises
all the purposes discussed above: preserving the parties’ rights, securing discovery of
evidence, preventing self-help and safeguarding the enforcement of the award.”'’ Aimed
at avoiding”’’ and neutralising”’’ interferences from national authorities, it constitutes a
development of the negative effect of the kompetenz-kompetenz principle provided for
by Art. 41 ICSID Convention. Apart from what has been discussed on the rule of

this issue 1s broader, as it

encompasses all sort of peri-arbitral obstruction by way of parallel proceedings.”'”

In regard to jurisdiction, it is particularly connected with preservation of evidence:
however, while the latter focuses on how jurisdiction will be exercised, the former
consists in the very power and duty to carry out its function. The Quiborax, Non
Metallic Minerals S.A. and Allan Fosk Kaplin v. Bolivia’'® case is the clearest example
of both aspects, namely interrelation and difference.

The dispute between the parties drew its origin from the revocation by the executive
power of eleven mining concessions allegedly held by Claimants.*'’ Considering this
governmental act a confiscatory measure in violation of the applicable BIT, Claimants
filed a request for arbitration before ICSID, which was registered on 6 February 2006.
At the end of 2008, criminal proceedings against Claimants and persons related to them
were insituted before the Courts of Bolivia, based on the accusations of forgery, use of
forged documents, fraud and destruction of personal property to defraud:*'* they were
accused of having forged minutes of a shareholders’ meeting in order to retroactively
reinforce the establishment of ICSID jurisdiction for the purpose of the then pending

arbitration. While Respondent intended thereby to protect its sovereignty on criminal

matters,”’’ Claimants maintained that criminal proceedings were being used with the
purpose of intimidating Claimants and some of its key witnesses and consequently
compell them to renounce their claims in the arbitration. In a nutshell, the parties
differed as to the need to: 1- protect the arbitral tribunal’s jurisdiction — since the
subject-matter of the two proceedings did not coincide, while undoubtedly criminal
proceedings were having an impact on the ICSID proceedings — and 2- to preserve
evidence.”””

221

The tribunal, while acknowledging — under the Perenco v. Ecuador test — that the

exclusivity of ICSID proceedings applies only to investment disputes,”** found that

“Claimants have shown the existence of a threat to the procedural integrity of the ICSID
proceedings, in particular with respect to their right to access to evidence through potential

witnesses’.

In sum, the arbitral tribunal decided to extend the need to protect its jurisdiction because
in that specific instance Claimant’s right to have potentially relevant evidence preserved
risked being impaired by Respondent’s conduct.’

As to the conditions for granting provisional measures, interestingly the tribunal

annulled the threshold of urgency”? and adopted the proportionality test embodied in

On those grounds, the tribunal issued a binding~”* provisional measure directing

In conclusion, the tribunal achieved the result of protecting both the integrity of the

exemplifies to a significant extent the interrelationships between conditions, purposes

and atypicalness of provisional measures in international investment arbitration.

C.1I. Measures aimed at preventing aggravation or exacerbation of the dispute
encompass a wide panorama of situations, which the general expression embraces: there

is no specific type of provisional measure in this respect.

*?° Quiborax v. Bolivia, para. 153: “The Tribunal agrees with Claimants that if measures are intended to

protect the procedural integrity of the arbitration, in particular with respect to access to or integrity of the
evidence, they are urgent by definition” [italics added, A/N].

°° According to Art. 17A of the UNCITRAL Model Law, the party requesting a provisional measures
shall demonstrate that “Harm not adequately repaired by an award of damages is likely to result if the
measure is not ordered, and such harm substantially outweighs the harm that is likely to result to the party
against whom the measure is directed if the measure is granted”.

27 See Quiborax v. Bolivia, paras. 154-165, particularly paras. 156-157; see also Convial Callao c. Perit,
Decision sobre solicitud de medidas provisionales fechada 22 Febrero 2011, par. 120: “Ambas Partes
sostienen que el Tribunal igualmente debe considerar la proporcionalidad de las medidas provisionales
solicitadas. Este Tribunal ha ponderado seriamente los posibles perjuicios que sufriria el Peru en caso de
decretar la medida provisional, pues esta es una tarea que no se debe tomar a la ligera. Asi, el Tribunal
considera que la proteccion a la integridad del proceso a la que tienen derecho las Demandantes respecto
de los sefiores Lowry y Guasco sobrepasa el posible perjuicio de la Demandada. En efecto, el Peri puede
seguir el proceso penal y al mismo tiempo abstenerse de tomar medidas que puedan entorpecer la
colaboracion de los sefiores Lowry y Guasco en el procedimiento arbitral. La situacion inversa no tiene el
mismo resultado: si el Peru, dentro del proceso penal, toma decisiones que entorpezcan la colaboracion de
los sefiores Lowry y Guasco en el procedimiento arbitral, el derecho de las Demandantes a presentar su

The aggravation | exacerbation binomial is an hendiadys which characterises the
inherent obligation of the parties with each other and towards the arbitral tribunal,
corresponding to the latter’s inherent power to issue provisional measures as discussed
above. It is by no means an obligation without a sanction, since damages caused in
breach thereof will be awarded to the party having suffered prejudice. Indeed, as it is
linked to the principle of good faith and abidance by the arbitration agreement, its
issuance in the course of the proceedings has a mere declaratory — not constitutive —
effect and therefore may play a role in terms of evidence.

Said binomial is in certain cases associated with the preservation of the status quo and
may be adopted as a sort of pre-provisional measure — in the form of a temporary

it is submitted that the necessary respect of the principle of contradictoire expressly
provided for in Art. 39, para. 4, ICSID Arbitration Rules does not apply, on three main

grounds:

- first of all, because it consists of a general obligation which applies even in the

absence of express mention;

- secondly, as it can be readily modified or revoked if groundless: the proportionality
test is flatly favourable to an effective application and quick revision, instead of facing

the risk of greater or even irreparable harm;

- most importantly, since ICSID tribunals’ inherent power renders the arbitral
mechanism able to confront situations where immediate decisions are unavoidable,
constituting moreover a corollary to the principles of good faith and abidance by the

arbitration agreement and the jurisdiction of the tribunal.

dispute, impairment of the rights Perenco was seeking to enforce in the arbitration and interference with
the Tribunal’s ability to grant effective relief. Since forcible collection measures could take effect within

restraining prohibiting Ecuador from undertaking any measures pending determination of the application
for provisional measures”.

not collegial and that the principle of contradictoire provided for by Art. 39, para. 4,

C.V. As anticipated above,*”* security for costs — also known under the Latin formula
cautio iudicatum solvi — 1s a species of the genus “measures aimed at securing the
enforcement of the award”: indeed, its purpose is to secure the potential enforcement of
the award in favour of Respondent against a losing impecunious or unwilling Claimant.
More developed than its counterpart, it can not however be said that this measure has
met with success in investment case law: indeed, the majority opinion is that the power
to order security for costs — be it based on Art. 47 ICSID Convention or on the theory of
inherent powers in annulment proceedings — should be adopted only in extreme
circumstances, such as when there is evidence of abuse of process.””° Accordingly, a
significant number of ICSID tribunals have rejected applications for security for

An additional concern is to avoid upholding hypothetical assumptions, namely that
Respondent will win the case and secondly that the case was so manifestly groundless
that Claimant will have to cover the totality of costs and expenses of the proceedings, at

an early stage; furthermore, the arbitral tribunal shall not prejudge the case.”**

Atypicalness of this measure consists in the form of guarantee: generally the posting of
a bond, entering into a deposit, a letter of credit and any other instrument having the
same objective. Its vitality may start a new life in the near future, after a very recent
development in the RSM Production Corporation v. Saint Lucia decision on security for
costs, handed down on 13 August 2014.” It is the first decision in which security for
costs was granted in investment treaty arbitration, mainly in consideration of the fact
that Claimant had been funded by a third party, an unknown litigation financier. The
peculiarity of such funding rose concerns about Claimant’s capability to pay an adverse
costs award. This investment contract arbitration was instituted following a request filed
with ICSID on 2 April 2012. In brief, the dispute arose from an exclusive oil
exploration license granted by Respondent to Claimant and modified thereafter due to
boundary disputes in that area, to the detriment of Claimant. RSM requests — arbitration
is still pending — an award prohibiting Respondent to grant to third parties any
exploration licenses in the disputed area or, in the alternative, declare that it breached its
contractual obligations and award damages.

On 6 September 2013, Respondent filed a request for provisional measures. After
written exchanges between the parties and the tribunal (opposition, reply and rejoinder),
a hearing was held on 4 October 2013. On 12 December 2013, the arbitral tribunal
issued its decision upon Saint Lucia’s request, directing Claimant to bear all advances
and refund Respondent of its costs to that date, whereas the decision on Respondent’s
request for security for costs was suspended.”°’ Thus, it constituted a sort of pre-
provisional measure or a halfway security for costs, since its breadth did not cover all
future envisageable expenses.

On 6 June 2014, Respondent reiterated its request for security for costs in addition to all
the other outstanding advances. It alleged urgency and necessity to protect its
procedural right against the risk that Claimant will be unable or unwilling to pay a costs

251

award very likely to be issued against it.~° In order to ground its position, Respondent

made reference to Claimant’s prior conduct in arbitration and domestic proceedings, in
which it failed to comply with costs awards and judgments rendered against it.
Furthermore, Claimant was funded by a third party under what Respondent depicted as
a sort of predatory scheme, whereby the third party funds the initiation of proceedings,
but neither Claimant nor the third party will comply with the costs award: in the words
of Gavan Griffith QC, arbitrator appointed by Respondent in that ICSID case, in his
Assenting Reasons — a sort of individual-concurring opinion — appended to the decision
under discussion, “such a business plan for a related or professional funder is to
embrace the gambler’s Nirvana: Heads I win, and Tails I do not lose”.*” Interestingly,
and correctly, Respondent denied the existence of the jurisdictional condition in relation
to this type of provisional measures, since it shall retain the right to contest jurisdiction
without having to renounce the availability of said measure.

On its side, Claimant denied the arbitral tribunal’s authority to grant security for costs,
mainly basing its position on the right to pursue its claim and on the Maffezini precedent
about the hypothetical nature of the related type of assessment, falling out of the right to
be preserved under Art. 47 ICSID Convention and Art. 39 Arbitration Rules.”

In its analysis of the request, the arbitral tribunal dealt with the issue of the
jurisdictional condition, without however finally deciding thereupon.””* In his Assenting
Reasons appended to the decision, arbitrator Gavan Griffith QC wished to express his

disagreement on this point, under the following terms:

“Paras 59 and 60. Whilst under a BIT treaty claim an investor claimant may be required to
establish prima facie jurisdiction to obtain an order for provisional measures, conceptually it is
inadmissible to apply any such requirement upon a respondent State party’s application for

security for costs orders.

°°? Assenting Reasons appended by Gavan Griffith QC to the Decision on Saint Lucia’s request for

security for costs, para. 13.

°° Decision, paras. 38 and 41.

°4 Decision, paras. 59-60: “It has regularly been held in previous ICSID arbitrations that a tribunal needs
to have, on a prima facie basis, subject matter jurisdiction. An argument favorable to that position is that
a tribunal which evidently does not have jurisdiction lacks the power to render any decision at all. On the
other hand, a respondent may well have a legitimate interest in obtaining security for costs even in cases
where the tribunal does not have subject matter jurisdiction. 60. In the case at issue, however, the
Tribunal need not finally decide upon the exact requirements, if any, of establishing its jurisdiction”.

238
Provisional Measures in International Investment Arbitration
Ph.D. Thesis — Federico Lenci

First, it is no function of the respondent State to establish jurisdiction: indeed the application
may be based upon the contention that there is none. Second, a respondent party has no
obligation to advance any case in defence on jurisdiction or on merits before the claimant has
made its case. Third, to require a respondent State to establish the negative against its own
interests, namely, as a pre-condition for the making of such orders in defence, would be a plain
breach of Article 52 of the Convention as a serious departure from a fundamental rule of
procedure.

For these reasons, I would recast the possibility hinted at paras. 59 and 60 to the level of an

absolute proposition that there is no requirement for a respondent party applying for provisional

measures to establish any, let alone prima facie, position on jurisdiction”.

In this regard, I find it even more relevant to state my position on the jurisdictional
condition, since the issue has never been addressed conclusively so far by any
investment tribunal: in cases of requests for security for costs, this condition shall be
reversed, 1.e. a prima facie assessment that jurisdiction to deal with the merits of the
case may lack shall even increase the opportunity to grant security for costs, if the other
conditions are met. Indeed, focusing on its purpose — namely, to protect Respondent’s
right to cover a favourable costs award against an impecunious or unwilling losing
Claimant — it seems that the probable lack of jurisdiction warrants the measure at issue
(an), whereas the point to be discussed shall be that of the amount of money (quantum)
to be secured in case of bifurcation of the proceedings (arguably a more reduced sum).
In a nutshell, and perhaps going even further than Gavan Griffith QC on this point, I
argue that no jurisdictional condition shall exist in these cases — agreeing with said
arbitrator — and, if Respondent wishes to object to jurisdiction, the prima facie lack
thereof shall play a role, contributing to the establishment of the other conditions, in
particular that of necessity.

As to the issue of rights to be preserved through provisional measures, the tribunal

dismissed the Maffezini precedent,’ upholding instead the approach advanced by the

°° Assenting Reasons, paras. 4-6.

°° Decision, paras. 72-73: “Furthermore, the Tribunal finds that the right to be preserved by a provisional
measure need not already exist at the time the request is made. Also future or conditional rights such as
the potential claim for cost rermbursement qualify as “rights to be preserved’. The hypothetical element
of the right at issue is one of the inherent characteristics of the regime of provisional measures. At the
same time, however, the prohibition of prejudging the merits of the case already at this stage ensures that
the conditional character of the respective right is duly taken into account. As long as interim measures do

Plama v. Bulgaria tribuna 1258

and followed by the Burlington v. Ecuador tribuna
whereby also procedural rights — including the alleged right to obtain reimbursement of
costs — may be protected.”””

Moreover, the tribunal paid attention to the circumstances of the case in relation to
Claimant’s consistent precedents of non-compliance in other ICSID and non-ICSID
proceedings, concluding that there were “compelling grounds for granting Respondent’s

260

request” and accordingly acceeded — by majority vote~”’ — to the request for security for

costs.7°!
Gavan Griffith QC, while agreeing on the conclusion of the tribunal, opined that the
strongest ground for security for costs in that case — as well as in others — concerned,
rather than the peculiar RSM history of non-compliance with awards and judgments, the
issue of third-party funding.“ His view is that, once it appears that a third party has
funded Claimant in order to allow it to institute proceedings, there should be a
presumptio iuris tantum that security for costs shall be granted to Respondent, unless
Claimant demonstrates contrary circumstances, such as its independent capacity to meet
cost orders. Such a fresh proposal indicates an aspect of the important role played by
provisional measures in securing equilibrium between the parties in the overall arbitral
process, thus normalising the relationship between the parties and improving its
efficacity. As reported by a commentator, his view has met with a mixed reaction by the

specialists in the field.” Professional litigation financiers seem to be divided.”™ His

not cross the line of a definite judgment, the right allegedly to be protected need, in the Tribunal’s
opinion, not definitely exist at the time the respective measure is issued. 73. Therefore, the (conditional)
right to reimbursement of legal costs qualifies as a right to be protected within the meaning of Article 47
ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 39 (1)”[footnote omitted, A/N].

Assenting Reasons constitute a “preposterous overreaction”. In a response to that article, Peter Griffin of
investment claims consultancy Slaney Advisors wrote that Bogart’s criticism and particularly his

240

Ph.D. Thesis — Federico Lenci

position even cost him a challenge filed by RSM under the ground that he has allegedly
demonstrated bias against third-party funded Claimants;*® if one reads his Asserting
Reasons, such a challenge seems to be manifestly groundless.

More importantly, this view is opposed by his co-arbitrator, Judge Nottingham, in his
dissenting opinion: according to him, firstly security for costs are not comprised within
the types of provisional measures which an ICSID tribunal may grant and, secondly,
these measures can not be ordered, but merely recommended. Addressing the first point,
he acutely pointed to the purpose of the ICSID Convention, namely that of encouraging
host States’ — and overall — economic development through foreign direct investments
by private parties; in this connection, security for costs would constitute an element of
unpredictability, contrary to the purpose of the ICSID Convention.”

Other reasons are advanced in order to exclude the availability of security for costs,
namely the hypothetical right argument contained in Maffezini,*°’ the different
provision contained in Art. 25, para. 2, of the LCIA Arbitration Rules” and the
undefined terms of the relevant provisions concerning provisional measures, which in
his opinion do not warrant such an invasive measure.” The second line of analysis
merely reproduces the debate about the legal authority of the ICSID arbitral tribunal to
issue provisional measures, therefore I draw the reader’s patience to the appropriate
section.”””

Very briefly, I incidentally and respectfully note his /ocus classicus of preaching strict
adherence to the treaty text on the belief — or even faith — that such an attitude will more
closely correspond to a correct interpretation under international law. However, the
opinion whereby various arbitral precedents reiterating that provisional measures are
binding, without any visible reaction from States in their BITs, Model BITs nor in their

investor-State contracts seems every day more adherent to the correct interpretation,

castigation of Gavan Griffith QC is “regrettable” (see Global Arbitration Review dated 26 September
2014).

following a modification in State practice in this direction. On the other hand, his view
that security for costs may run against the purpose of the ICSID Convention due to its
unpredictability has some merits, while at the same time it has to be recalled that the
drafters’ intention was precisely that of drafting general provisions in many areas,
leaving the task of specifying their contents to the ensuing arbitral case law. Whether
arbitral case law is — or will ever be — sufficiently consistent and which force shall be
attributed to arbitral precedents constitutes another debate which has been discussed in
the previous chapter.””

In my opinion, a link between third-party funding and security for costs shall by no
means be automatic, not even on a iuris tantum basis: indeed, the automatism shall
apply only if the third-party funder refuses to cover adverse costs award. The onus shall
be cast on Claimant to produce a written document before the arbitral tribunal,
disclosing the identity of the third-party funder and demonstrating the existence of an
agreement between Claimant and the latter, whereby it undertakes the obligation to
cover said costs and expenses.

The issue whether third-party funding should automatically provoke an order granting
security for costs against Claimant has been the subject of debates among arbitrators,
scholars and practitioners in recent years. It is mainly a common law institution which
finds provisions and wider application in that context, such as the English Civil
Procedural Rules,’” the English Arbitration Act 1996°” and the LCIA Rules.*” It is
significantly applied in international commercial arbitration under the referred norms.

In an interesting article published last year, a point is correctly made on the fact that

security for costs shall not be automatically linked to third-party funding, since it

“would unfairly penalize claimants with meritorious claims, but who had relied upon third-party

funding rather than alternative forms of financing a claim [since the same approach — namely

the automatic issuance of security for costs under discussion — is not advanced in relation to the
presence of other instruments for borrowing, such as contingency fee agreements, bank loans or
conditional fee agreements, A/N]. It would also unfairly reward respondents who had no

realistic chance of being awarded costs at the end of the arbitration, but were requesting security

for costs on a purely tactical basis”.~”

In my opinion, in international investment arbitration the issue of third-party funders
shall inevitably raise serious concerns, due to the arbitrators’ lack of imperium vis-a-vis
third parties: unlike judges in some jurisdictions, they lack power to order payment to
those parties, should the losing Claimant be unable to cover an adverse costs award.
Moreover, the arbitral hit-and-run shall be contrasted.” At the same time, should the
automatic approach be followed, this would open the way to abusive actions from
Respondent in order to stifle genuine claims’”’ (e.g., by systematically applying for
security, in order to increase Claimant’s costs or prevent it from having recourse to
third-party schemes). Automatisms shall be avoided: on the contrary, the guiding star
has to be — as in many other respects — the flexible principle of good faith in the

evaluation of the conduct of both parties: its application will guarantee fair results.

Section three: looking beyond the current status. Treatification and

contractualisation of provisional measures

in international investment arbitration

International investment arbitration is triggered by three groups of instruments. These
groups are (1) the piece of legislation on investments enacted by the host State, (11) the
investment treaty between host State and home State and/or (111) the agreement between
the host State and the foreign investor (investor-State contract).

Investment legislation of the host State may allow foreign investors to institute arbitral
proceedings (investment /aw arbitration).

The investment treaty — BIT or MIT — allows the foreign investor having the nationality
of the home State to file its claim against the host State to the appropriate arbitral forum
according to the arbitral clause contained in the treaty (investment treaty arbitration).
Thirdly, the arbitral clause contained in the investor-State contract may allow for
investment contract arbitration.””

These three normative layers interact with each other and determine both the substantial
and the procedural framework of the arbitration proceeding. The clearest example of
this interaction is constituted by umbrella clauses, namely provisions whereby States
agree in the BIT to comply with each and every contractual commitment they may enter
to with foreign investors of what will eventually be the home State: indeed, genuine
umbrella clauses serve the purpose of bridging the gap between different layers, as a
sort of normative elevator.

The role of contract in investment arbitration is not limited to the establishment of a
different substantial protection — which would necessarily be higher than that of the BIT
— to covered investments, since it can also represent a new frontier of arbitration, setting
more specific procedural /eges speciales. In this respect, it is worth noting that, contrary
to substantial protection (which can only be increased through contract), such a
procedural protection may either be increased or decreased through contract;

accordingly, there arises its potential value, which is to crystallise bargaining.

Provisional Measures in International Investment Arbitration
Ph.D. Thesis — Federico Lenci

For example, let us consider provisional measures and the complex issue concerning
their legal authority. As we have seen, there is an ongoing phenomenon which I call
treatification of provisional measures, where the treaty plays the role of lex specialis in
relation to the relevant arbitration rules (ICSID, UNCITRAL, and so forth): in this
instance, the treaty specifies whether the tribunal is empowered to issue binding or
recommendatory measures, or both. Indeed, in EnCana Corp. v. Government of
Ecuador case, the special provision contained in the treaty reinforced the arbitral
tribunal’s authority to issue binding interim measures. *”” Said phenomenon is likely to
acquire more relevance in the near future, considering the tendency of arbitral
proceedings to last longer and the understanding of the role it plays.

A phenomenon parallel to treatification may be that of contractualisation of said
measures, operating at the third layer presented above. While it is true that it constitutes
up to now a theoretical exercise, since there seem to be no examples thereof in current
arbitral practice, its availability should not be set aside. How would it operate? First of
all, there should be an alignment between the treaty and the contractual arbitral clauses,
say, providing for ICSID arbitration; otherwise, the host State’s jurisdictional offer in
the contract would absorb the /ex specialis concerning provisional measures, even in the
presence of umbrella clauses (which operate on the substantial level, equalising contract
claims and treaty claims). Secondly, umbrella clauses would not be necessary, since
contractualisation of provisional measures provides for a /ex specialis relating to a
jurisdictional offer which would have already been made. Apart from better tailoring the
legal protection to the specific investment, such a choice would be able to increase its
legal security in arbitration, due to the relatively inconsistent ICSID arbitral
jurisprudence on this point. Moreover, it is submitted that it would be more consistent
with “the” cornerstone of arbitration, which is party autonomy. This would be achieved
in its very essence, since the contractual parties are the very ones who possibly will be
parties in arbitration, contrary to the treaty parties (one of which is absent): in this sense,
contractualisation of the arbitral procedure regarding investments is more representative

of party autonomy than any BIT provision of the same kind.

CHAPTER FOUR

THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PROVISIONAL MEASURES
IN INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT ARBITRATION

Introduction to the problem. — Section one: normative framework. A. ICSID Convention
and Arbitration Rules. -B. UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules and the Model Law. — Section
two: scenarios in the course of arbitration proceedings and relevant practice. A.
Compliance. — B. Non-compliance and its legal consequences. — C. Possibility for the

addressee to oppose tribunal-ordered provisional measures.

Introduction to the problem. Implementation of provisional measures comprises
two different behaviours of the addressee: voluntary compliance on one side,
coercive measures before State courts (enforcement) — when the addressee does
not comply voluntarily with provisional measures — on the other. Said
implementation constitutes a corollary of the abidance by the arbitration
agreement, since, through its conclusion, the parties conferred adjudicatory power
to a specific organ; accordingly, they shall abstain from any measure capable of
prejudicing the execution of its final decision. In this connection, in the absence of
an agreement to the contrary,’ they have to cooperate with the arbitral tribunal and
facilitate its task: failure to abide by arbitral provisional measures inevitably
ageravates the dispute between the parties, in violation of the arbitration
agreement; the more so, when the dispute settlement mechanism does not provide
for enforcement of these measures, as we will see in relation to ICSID arbitration.
In any case, the premise for a legal analysis of this topic shall necessarily be the
binding force of provisional measures. However, the relationship between
enforceability and their legal authority only goes in this direction:* indeed, while

it is true that non-binding measures are ipso facto unenforceable, this does not

L.e., it is univocal.

247

imply that unenforceable measures shall necessarily be non-binding; therefore,

one may be well advised not to mix up the two planes.°

Contrary to ICSID arbitration, the UNCITRAL Arbitration rules provide for
enforcement of provisional measures through the assistance of State courts. Such
assistance is not limited to the courts of the State where arbitration proceedings
have their seat, but potentially involves the participation of the courts of other
countries, in whose territory enforcement is sought. In this vein, it can be said that
the delocalised ICSID system coexists with the plurilocalised UNCITRAL
system. In this regard, it is submitted that the relevant State court shall not verify
the existence of the jurisdictional condition for provisional measures, namely the
arbitral prima facie jurisdiction: this is part of the negative effect of the
kompetenz-kompetenz principle;’ at the same time, it has to be acknowledged that

such an effect is not widely recognized by State courts.”

For the purposes of the present chapter in relation to investment arbitration under
the UNCITRAL Arbitration rules, the present analysis will be focused on the

enforcement of tribunal-ordered — as opposed to court-ordered — provisional

“Under the negative effect of the kompetenz-kompetenz principle, State courts abstain from
verifying whether the arbitral tribunal is competent to deal with the merits of the case or not. This
is the prevailing view in French jurisprudence and doctrine; see, for an analysis of compatibility
with Art. 2(3) of the 1958 New York Convention, GAILLARD, BANIFATEMI, Negative Effect of
Competence-Competence: The Rule of Priority in Favour of the Arbitrators, 11 GAILLARD, DI
PIETRO (eds.), Enforcement of Arbitration Agreements and International Arbitral Awards: The
New York Convention in Practice, London, 2008, 258: “Providing for the arbitrators’ power to rule
on their own jurisdiction, this principle [i.e., the kompetenz-kompetenz principle, A/N] embodies
the mirroring effect that the courts should refrain from engaging into the examination of the
arbitrators’ jurisdiction before the arbitrators themselves have had an opportunity to do so. Known
as the ‘negative effect of the principle of competence-competence’, this rule of priority in favour
of the arbitrators, today increasingly recognised in practice, exemplifies the specific nature and
autonomy of international arbitration, in full harmony with the New York Convention’s
philosophy of recognition of validity of the arbitration agreement and of the award resulting from
the arbitral process”. See, for a critical opinion, BREKOULAKIS, The Negative Effect of

measures:° the reason for this choice lies in the self-executing power of the latter’
under the laws of procedure of the national legal order where said enforcement is

sought.

After an outline of the normative framework concerning the implementation of
provisional measures in section one, section two considers what may happen
when these measures are issued: indeed, tribunal-ordered provisional measures
may either be voluntarily complied with (A) or not (B), entailing in the latter case
the availability of two options for the innocent party; such options — alternative,
but not mutually exclusive’ — consist in the arbitral power to draw adverse
inferences and/or to award damages” and in the availability of court

enforcement. They are not mutually exclusive, for two main reasons.

obvious such difference is that orders given by arbitrators are not self-executing, like those of

performing certain acts”; see also TWEEDDALE, A., TWEEDDALE, K., Arbitration of Commercial
Disputes, Oxford, 2007, para. 9.57 (quoted in part below, footnote 8).

* See, contra, TWEEDDALE, A., TWEEDDALE, K., quoted supra footnote 7, ibid.: “Orders made by
the arbitral tribunal are not self-enforcing. Where a party refuses to comply with an order that the
arbitral tribunal has made then it may penalize that party by drawing an adverse inference from its
refusal or sanction that party with costs. Alternatively, if the arbitral tribunal is not empowered to
sanction the defaulting party in that manner then a national court may be asked to enforce the
order” [italics added, A/N].

” See MINE v. Guinea, Award dated 6 January 1988, 4 ICSID Reports 59, 69: “In view of Article
47 and the applicable ICSID Rules, the Tribunal will take into account in its award the
consequences of any failure by MINE to abide by these recommendations”.

'° As already said, an arbitral tribunal cannot compel compliance, due to its lack of imperium.

Firstly, even when the arbitral tribunal is empowered to draw adverse inferences
and/or to award damages, in certain instances, the ensuing damages cannot be
properly evaluated, due to the very violation of the provisional measure, as in the
cases of preservation of evidence: under such circumstances, if the applicable
instrument provides for court enforcement, it is meaningless to compel the
innocent party to suffer such a violation and wait for an imprecise award on
damages (in the most fortunate scenario, since it may even lose its case for lack of

evidence! ).

Secondly, it is reminded that one of the substantive conditions for granting
provisional measures (either under the Burlington or the Plama test)'' is that of
necessity-irreparable damage, i.e. a damage which cannot be restored through
monetary compensation: therefore, it would be manifestly contradictory to award
damages in that scenario, because it would mean that the substantive condition at
issue may not be satisfied, unless we admit that in such cases the arbitral tribunal
may be empowered to award punitive damages (a doubtful and undesirable

option, if we compare it with court enforcement).

Finally, paragraph C addresses the procedural instrument available to the
addressee in order to oppose the arbitral tribunal’s decision on provisional
measures. In this as well as in all other regards, relevant practice both in
administered arbitration under the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules and
ad hoc arbitration under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules will be considered in

order to evaluate the current practice in international investment arbitration.

Section one: normative framework

A. ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules

A. The effectiveness of provisional measures is of utmost relevance for both the
measure itself and, in general, the proper functioning of any dispute settlement
mechanism empowered with this procedural instrument.’’ Indeed, it constitutes
the very essence of provisional measures,'° and its lack is able to deprive the latter
of any utility'* and to weaken the adjudicatory organ through the impact on its

authority.

Despite such relevance, and to a certain extent, because of it, there 1s no provision
on the recognition and enforcement of provisional measures, neither in the ICSID
Convention nor in the Arbitration Rules. From a broader perspective, it has been
noted that this is a general problem in public-international-law adjudication. '”

In the ICSID Convention, provisions on recognition and enforcement are limited
to awards, therefore they are not applicable to provisional measures, which can
only be rendered through procedural orders, decisions and in special instances
directions. Indeed, an award in the ICSID system is a final decisions,'° not subject

to modification nor revocation as in the case of provisional decisions, which are

'S MCLACHLAN, The Continuing Controversy over Provisional Measures in International
Disputes, in Les mesures provisoires en droit international, ILA International Law Forum —

measures, it is remarkable how limited the extent of their recognition and enforcement outside the
court awarding them has been” (also referred to in ZIADE, R., quoted supra footnote 14, 214).

'® An indication is this sense is provided by Art. 53(2) ICSID Convention, pursuant to which “for
the purposes of this Section [Section 6, on recognition and enforcement of the award, A/N],
“award” shall include any decision interpreting, revising or annulling such award pursuant to
Articles 50, 51 or 52”.

temporary in nature.'” Art. 54(1) ICSID Convention — which mentions the term

award four times in that paragraph — reads as follows:

“Each Contracting State shall recognize an award [italics added, A/N] rendered pursuant
to this Convention as binding and enforce the pecuniary obligations imposed by that
award [idem ut supra] within its territories as if 1t were a final judgment of a court in that
State. A Contracting State with a federal constitution may enforce such an award [idem ut

supra] in or through its federal courts and may provide that such courts shall treat the

award [idem ut supra] as if it were a final judgment of the courts of a constituent State”.'*

In addition, the institution of diplomatic protection is equally inapplicable in
relation to provisional measures as an instrument for the enforcement of these
measures in the ICSID system, precisely for the same terminological reason:
according to Art. 27(1) ICSID Convention, home States shall not give diplomatic
protection to their nationals involved in a dispute with a given host State, unless
the latter State “shall have failed to abide by and comply with the award rendered
in such dispute”.

However, it is possible to construe the necessary assistance of State courts to
ICSID arbitration by reference to other norms. It has been evidenced that, under
international law, the obligation of those States which agreed to submit to ICSID
arbitration — and thereby not to frustrate the object of the proceedings — extends to
their judiciaries by virtue of Art. 27 VCLT:”’ consequently, according to this

interpretation, State courts of those legal orders would be under the obligation to

or revoke its recommendations”.

'8 Art. 54(1) ICSID Convention, available at the Centre’s institutional website. It is noted
incidentally that the second sentence merely reproduces a customary norm in international law,
later enshrined — in 1969 — in Art. 27 VCLT, whereby a State party to a treaty is prevented from
invoking its internal law as a justification for its failure to comply with its international
obligations: accordingly, the internal organisation of the judiciary in a federal State can by no
means prejudice that State’s compliance with the obligation to recognize and enforce an award
rendered pursuant to the ICSID Convention, obviously provided that it is a party thereto.

'° Art. 27 VCLT reads as follows: “A party may not invoke the provisions of its internal law as
justification for its failure to perform a treaty. This rule is without prejudice to article 46 [on the
competence to conclude treaties, A/N]”.

252

give effect to ICSID provisional measures. In the words of Mavrogordato and

Sidere,

“The failure to comply with them [1.e., ICSID provisional measures, A/N] would
constitute a breach of the general obligation not to frustrate the object of the proceedings
and/or the obligation to submit to ICSID jurisdiction. Such obligations extend to the local
courts of the state party concerned and, arguably, to all signatories to the Convention. By
virtue of art. 27 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, states are responsible
for the actions of their judiciaries and cannot rely on local laws (such as Law 105/1992)
[1.e., the internal law prohibiting enforcement of tribunal-ordered provisional measures in

the ICSID case under that comment, namely Roussalis v. Romania, A/N] to excuse non-

compliance with international obligations”.””

In this sense, the decision of an ICSID tribunal would constitute an international
norm,”' of whose abidance State courts and, as a second step, their States are
responsible. This opinion has the merit of connecting the implementation of
ICSID provisional measures to the general obligation arising from the ratification
of the Convention and involving States parties thereto, together with their organs;
however, a clarification is deemed necessary in this respect: which States and,
consequently, which courts are bound to give effect to ICSID provisional
measures issued in the course of arbitration proceedings between “party A” and
“State party B”? All States parties to the ICSID Convention, or only those States
more directly involved in the specific case before the arbitral tribunal, namely
State party B-Respondent (generally, the host State) and the home State of party
A (ie., the State of which Claimant (A) is a national)? Undoubtedly, the

through the operation of the power delegated to the international court by the States parties to the
jurisdictional agreement, has been developed by MORELLI, La sentenza internazionale, Padova,
1931, 212 ff. This reasoning is equally applicable in the ICSID framework, due to the origin of the
attribution to the Centre of the relevant jurisdiction.

253

difference has both theoretical and practical relevance. The passage above seems
to opt for the former view,” however without advancing any justification.

In fact, the international obligation at issue may be seen as not indefinitely
extending to all States parties to the ICSID Convention, to the extent that they
have not ratified the investment treaty (BIT or MIT) containing the ICSID
arbitration clause, i.e. the instrument upon which such an international obligation
— to submit to ICSID arbitration — is constituted. Indeed, ratification of the ICSID
Convention does in no way entail ICSID jurisdiction to rule upon investment
disputes: to that end, it is necessary to apply a second instrument, which is the
ICSID arbitration clause; this instrument may be contained in a treaty, a contract
or host State legislation, otherwise ICSID arbitration cannot be triggered by the
prospective investor. Consequently, only the host State and the home State may
be under an obligation to implement a tribunal-ordered provisional measure,
provided that they have not otherwise agreed in the relevant instruments
containing the arbitration clause.

One of the most significant applications of this construction is arguably the
injunction to suspend or discontinue parallel proceedings before local courts, in
order to preserve the integrity of the proceedings pursuant to Art. 47 and Art. 26
of the ICSID Convention. Said injunction has so far been directed to the parties to
arbitration: if the addressee fails to abide by the injunction, the innocent party is
arguably entitled to request from the State court the implementation of the
tribunal-ordered provisional measure, with the limit of international public policy.
In this regard, the cooperative attitude of the Court of Appeals in Rennes in the
MINE y. Guinea case referred to above” to lift attachments to Guinean assets may

be considered a voluntary compliance — as opposed to a compulsory one — with

*? For another quite unclear view on this aspect, apparently advancing the idea that State courts of
all States parties to the ICSID Convention would be bound by this obligation, see ZIADE, R.,
quoted supra footnote 14, 218: “S’il peut paraitre contestable que les tribunaux étatiques puissent
assister les parties dans la mise en cevre des <<recommandations>> des tribunaux CIRDI, lesdites
recommandations s’imposent néanmoins aux juridictions étatiques. En effet, selon les régles du
droit international, les Etats sont responsables des agissements de leurs propres juridictions, ce qui
devrait assurer une certaine efficacité a tout le moins aux recommandations qui concernent la
suspension des procédures étatiques paralléles” [footnote omitted, A/N].

tribunal-ordered provisional measures.” As a matter of fact, the justification for
such an extensive international obligation of State courts to implement these
measures is a corollary of the general obligation not to frustrate the object and
purpose of the ICSID Convention, as expressed in its preamble.”°

The availability of State court enforcement may be rendered more effectively
grounded through a specific provision to that effect by mutual agreement between
the parties in the relevant instrument.”°

In any manner, from a practical point of view parties are more likely to comply if
it is established that provisional measures are binding,”’ as demonstrated in the
analysis of the current practice in ICSID case law.** In this connection, the
interpretation of provisional measures as binding would be in line with the
travaux préparatoires of the ICSID Convention, based on the distinction between
their binding as confronted to enforceable nature: provisional measures, being

temporary in nature, are not enforceable (contrary to final awards), but

26 Contra, BISMUTH, quoted supra footnote 7, 789: “It must also be stressed that the /ex arbitralis
specialis cannot, in our opinion, transform an arbitral decision on provisional measures into an
award benefiting from the enforcement mechanism of the ICSID Convention”. While I agree with
Dr. Bismuth that party autonomy cannot render provisional measures enforceable as if they were
awards in the sense of Art. 54 ICSID Convention, I argue that State courts will be more confident
in complying with their obligation in the presence of a an agreement to this effect freely entered
into between the parties. In my opinion, party autonomy will play a significant role in this sector,
as indicated in Chapter three, section four (through treatification and contractualisation). For
examples of arbitration agreements concerning scope and implementation of provisional measures,
which can be inserted in investor-State contracts, see (in Spanish) FRIEDLAND, LLANO ODDONE,

B. UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules and the Model Law

B. The UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules contain more straightforward provisions on
the recognition and enforcement of tribunal-ordered provisional measures than
does the ICSID system.

First of all, the arbitral tribunal may issue these measures in the form of an award
or an order.°° Due to its more formal requirements, the issuance of an award
usually takes more time than that of an order: therefore, reasons of peculiar
urgency may require preference for the second form, sacrificing the effective
enforcement of the measure in a balanced evaluation. However, when urgency is
not peculiar (though existing), the arbitral tribunal will generally be inclined to
issue an interim award. Indeed, Art. 34(1) of the 2010 UNCITRAL Arbitration
Rules permits such an option, reading that “the arbitral tribunal may make
separate awards on different issues at different times”. The following paragraph
provides that any award is final and binding on the parties, with the parties
undertaking to carry out such award without delay.

Despite the apparent contradiction of a final instrument embodying a decision
which is temporary in nature,” the parties to investment treaties containing such
an option for arbitration under the UNCITRAL Rules reinforce the binding power
of interim measures through their mutual undertaking to provide in their territories
for their enforcement.”

Furthermore, dealing with the enforcement of provisional measures in relation to
the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, it is worth considering Art. 26(8), providing
that

“The party requesting an interim measure may be liable for any costs and damages caused

by the measure to any party if the arbitral tribunal later determines that, in the

°° See, e.g., Chevron Corp. and Texaco Petroleum Company v. Republic of Ecuador, Second

circumstances then prevailing, the measure should not have been granted. The arbitral

tribunal may award such costs and damages at any point during the proceedings”.

This norm addresses the issue of liability of the requesting party if the provisional
measure is later found to be groundless. Considering the equality of the parties,
this paragraph serves the purpose of construing addressee’s necessary compliance
with the provisional measure rendered against it. Indeed, Art. 26(6) contains the
availability of an arbitral provisional countermeasure, namely an appropriate
security in connection with the provisional measure, aimed at covering costs and
damages for its implementation. In a nutshell, if the requesting has to face the
potential liability for costs and damages deriving from a groundless provisional
measure, at the same time it is fair that the addressee shall cover costs and
damages caused by its failure to comply with the provisional measure, and
perhaps a fortiori, due to the aggravating factor of having disobeyed a decision
issued by the arbitral tribunal.

In Chevron and Texaco vy. Ecuador, the arbitral tribunal acceded to Claimant’s
request for provisional measures, namely through an injunction to suspend
enforcement of local proceedings against Claimant before the local courts in
Ecuador. In the same interim award, it reiterated the requesting party’s obligation
under Art. 26(8) UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules to cover Respondent’s costs and
losses incurred by the latter in performing its obligation. In addition, it ordered
Claimant to deposit a sum of US$ 50 Million as a security for said costs (what I
term the arbitral provisional countermeasure, since it serves the function of a

os 33
provisional measure).

may suffer in performing its legal obligations under this Second Interim Award, as may be decided
by the Tribunal within these arbitration proceedings (to the exclusion of any other jurisdiction);
and further that, as security for such contingent responsibility the Claimants shall deposit within
thirty days of the date of this Second Interim Award the amount of US$ 50,000,000.00 (United
States Dollars Fifty Million) with the Permanent Court of Arbitration in a manner to be designated
separately, to the order of this Tribunal”.

Furthermore, costs and damages arising out of actions performed in violation of
the mutual obligation not to frustrate the outcome of the proceedings and to avoid
extending the dispute — a general obligation, which does not require a specific
provisional measure to that effect — are taken into account by the arbitral tribunal
in its final award: this constitutes an intra-arbitral instrument of implementation of
provisional measures.

The more effective system provided for by the UNCITRAL system in this topic is
confirmed by the norms contained in another instrument within this regime,
namely the 2006 Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration. Art. 17 is
significantly broad, following the US statutory tradition. Indeed, the drafters
intended to provide State courts with a detailed guidance as to the conditions for
granting provisional measures and their scope, basically with the idea that said
guidance would facilitate their task and confidence to cooperate with the arbitral

tribunal at the phase of enforcement.** Art. 17H(1) provides that

“An interim measure issued by an arbitral tribunal shall be recognized as binding and,
unless otherwise provided by the arbitral tribunal, enforced upon application to the

competent court, irrespective of the country in which it was issued”.

This general norm requiring State court assistance in the implementation of
provisional measures through the application of imperium is subject to some
exceptions. They coincide grosso modo with the exceptions whereby a State court
may refuse to recognize a final award. In addition, a State court may decide to
deny enforcement to a tribunal-ordered provisional measure if it finds that the
requesting party has failed to comply with the security issued in order to cover the
measure: in other words, the court of enforcement is entitled to verify its

compliance with the tribunal’s arbitral provisional countermeasure issued

pursuant to Art. 28(6) UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules and, after verifying its
violation, may deny enforcement of the provisional measure.

In the Chevron and Texaco case referred to above, this would have occurred if
Claimants had failed to deposit the sum of US$ 50 Million as decided by the
arbitral tribunal. In like circumstances, of course if that party is not excused by
external factors which prevented it from abiding by the decision nor if the
decision is abnormal, the requesting party, also called innocent party, becomes,
say, to a certain extent guilty and therefore shall bear the consequences of its
(in)actions in terms of unenforceability of the provisional measure. In addition to
this exception, enforcement can be denied where the measure is not compatible
with the State court’s own powers, or where it has been suspended or terminated
by the tribunal or by the courts of the /ocus arbitri.>

Therefore, the current situation concerning enforceability of provisional measures
in investment arbitration under the UNCITRAL Rules seems to correspond to that
existing in international commercial arbitration.*°

Although UNCITRAL provisional measures appear to be more readily
enforceable than ICSID provisional measures, the difference may be limited in the
investment arbitration context. Indeed, even though a State party is bound by the
UNCITRAL Rules to implement interim measures, there seem to be no practical
means of enforcing this obligation through the host State’s courts.

The situation is arguably similar in relation to monetary awards rendered under
the UNCITRAL Rules: although they can theoretically be enforced by execution
on assets located in the host State by operation of the 1958 New York Convention

on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards, they will normally

* See Arts. 171 and 36 2006 UNCITRAL Model Law.

°° The current situation in international commercial arbitration has been aptly summarised — in
relation to Argentina, though it represents the general tendency — by Professor Tawil under the
following terms: “Enforcement of provisional measures must be sought exclusively through State
courts. Arbitral tribunals lack the necessary imperium to execute their orders by force. In cases
such as actual attachment of assets ordered by the arbitral tribunal, the parties or the arbitral
tribunal shall request enforcement from the courts. Although compelled to support arbitral
proceedings, the courts frequently second-guess the arbitral tribunal’s decision by verifying that all
legal requirements for granting preliminary measures were met in the case at hand”. (TAWIL,
Argentina, in Int’] Handbook on Commercial arbitration, edited by PAULSSON, Alphen aan den
Ryn, 2011, 19).

lack jurisdiction to compel compliance with an arbitral tribunal’s interim award.*’
Moreover, the issue of the enforceability of interim awards in national courts as
“foreign awards” under the New York Convention is controversial.”®

However, Gary Born’s review of cases in this matter seems to indicate the correct
evolution of the subject, towards the enforceability of interim awards also in
relation to investor-State arbitration.*’

In conclusion, it is submitted that the UNCITRAL normative framework does not
require amendments for tribunal-ordered provisional measures to be enforced

before State courts: evolution towards their more stable enforceability may

originate from judicial practice.

issue interim measures of protection in the form of interim awards. Such a possibility is expressly
envisaged, for example, in Art. 26(2) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. This raises the
question whether the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards
covers also such interim awards. As the Convention does not define the term “award”, it is not
clear whether the Convention applies to interim awards as well. The prevailing view, confirmed
also by case law in some States, appears to be that the Convention does not apply to interim
awards” (available at the UNCITRAL institutional website: —http://daccess-dds-

Section two: scenarios in the course of arbitration proceedings

and relevant practice

A. Compliance

A. As already mentioned, parties are more willing to comply if it is admitted that
provisional measures are binding. Other factors have an impact on the addressee’s
acceptance of the decision on provisional measures, namely the establishment of
jurisdiction to rule on the merits of the case: comparing two cases, if all the other
variables are unchanged, arguably the degree of voluntary compliance with a
provisional measure is directly proportional to the height of the threshold adopted
by the tribunal concerning the jurisdictional condition to issue the latter measure.
Let me give a brief example. In the first case, the tribunal adopts the Anglo-
Iranian test, namely the prima facie jurisdiction — negative-perspective view (“so
far, it has not been demonstrated that I do not have jurisdiction”). In another case,
the tribunal adopts the Churchill Mining test, namely the fumus bonae
iurisdictionis — positive-perspective view (“there is a provisional basis whereby I

at as ny 40
may have jurisdiction’).

In the second scenario, the tribunal opts for a more demanding threshold for the
jurisdictional condition to be met: consequently, in my opinion, the addressee of
the decision will be more inclined to comply therewith under the fumus bonae
iurisdictionis condition than the former, if all other conditions remain unchanged.
The parallelism between this condition and compliance with provisional measures
has been underlined by Simpson and Fox in their classic study on international

as Al
arbitration.

*° See Chapter three, section two, AIL.

*! SIMPSON, FOX, Jnternational Arbitration, London, 1959, 167: “The further the Court goes, as in

question of jurisdiction, the harder it becomes to say that a defendant state, which is contesting the

Provisional Measures in International Investment Arbitration
Ph.D. Thesis — Federico Lenci

As a general matter, the obligation to abide by the provisional measures issued by
an arbitral tribunal derives from the obligation to respect the integrity of the
proceedings: it is a corollary of the respect of the arbitration agreement freely

entered into between the parties.”

Although arbitral tribunals lack the imperium to enforce their provisional
measures, addressees tend to comply voluntarily in the great majority of cases,”

for a series of reasons.

First of all, compliance is part of an intuitive strategy: parties inevitably pay
attention to the way in which they are perceived by the arbitral tribunal and do not
want to be cast in a bad light. They are aware that uncooperative behaviours are
detrimental for themselves in the first place, putting the fair conduct of the

proceedings at risk.**

Secondly, as we will see in the following paragraph, non-compliance entails
adverse consequences in terms of monetary compensation, since for example
disobedient respondents may, in the event of losing their case, even have to pay
accrued amounts of monetary compensation in considerations of costs and

damages caused.

Thirdly — and particularly in relation to respondents — host States appearing as
defendants before investment tribunals are aware of the fact that the attentive eyes
of the international business community are turned to their procedural behaviour:

reasons of international prestige and marketing to be considered investor-friendly

jurisdiction is or should be bound to take the interim measures indicated by the Court”. Although
the authors referred to State-to-State adjudication, this reasoning is valid for all public-
international-law adjudication.

tribunal, or aggravate the dispute”.

environments in order to attract foreign direct investments play a fundamental role
in the current context. In addition to that, both States and investors necessarily
take into account the fact that in the last decade the policy at ICSID has changed
towards a significant level of transparency: an unfavourable strepitus fori is a
further element which may be detrimental to their image. In this connection, it is
deemed useful to recall that this element was at the centre of Indonesia’s request
for provisional measures in Churchill Mining PLC v. Republic of Indonesia, as
well as in Amco v. Indonesia thirty years earlier. In Churchill Mining PLC v.
Republic of Indonesia, Respondent requested, inter alia, “that the tribunal order
Claimant to refrain from making false, unfounded and misleading statements in
the media regarding the case at hand”.”’ The dispute had originated from the
alleged revocation of mining licenses by Respondent. According to Indonesia,
Claimant’s conduct in the press was depicting the host State as an unfavourable
scene for foreign direct investments with the additional aim of exerting pressure
and gaining a negotiation tool in that regard: accordingly, the purpose for its
request of provisional measures was that of preventing self-help.”° In its response,
Claimant relied on Amco v. Indonesia,"’ World Duty Free v. Kenya” and EDF v.
Romania” as evidence of a tendency contrary to the alleged right to
confidentiality. The arbitral tribunal, after recalling that in Amco v. Indonesia the
issues were similar, since Indonesia complained of various newspaper articles that
it considered harmful, found that the ICSID framework did not impose
confidentiality and that the alleged “right to attract foreign investment” and

analogous formulations made by Respondent were not rights in dispute worth of

recommendation for provisional measures.°’ Thus, in the case under comment the
arbitral tribunal ruled that the applicant had failed to qualify the right that may
justify provisional measures, precisely because the alleged right to confidentiality
does not exist in ICSID arbitration as an absolute right. Therefore, parties pay a
great deal of attention before deciding to disregard a decision granting provisional
measures against them: quite often, disregarding these decisions will be more
harmful to themselves than complying therewith.

Fourthly, from a non-strictly-legal point of view, States will increasingly tend to
comply with ICSID provisional measures, since another actor which will — and
does already — take State conduct into account is the World Bank, before deciding
whether to finance a given project involving that State, or not.°' Such an attitude,
which goes under the name of conditionality, is not exclusive of the World Bank.
Indeed, another third party, though it does not belong to the World Bank Group,
plays this same role, mutatis mutandis: it is the International Monetary Fund
(IMF).°” By way of example, although it is not directly related to provisional
measures (but signifying exactly the same approach), it is well known that at the
beginning of the disputes against Argentina, following its economic crisis in
December 2001 and the abrogation of the pesificacion of the US Dollar, the IMF
threatened the Country to withhold loans therefrom until its executive branch
reached an agreement with its bondholders.’ The existence of these manceuvres,
though not very orthodox, shall always be kept in mind when assessing the
rationales for State conduct in arbitration proceedings; perhaps, they contribute to

the abandonment of the convenient myth of David and Goliath’ in international

B. Non-compliance and its legal consequences

B. The possibility always exists for arbitral tribunals, in case a party does not
comply with a decision on provisional measures, to take that conduct into account
in the final award.°° During the negotiations of the ICSID Convention, the drafters
considered the inclusion of a provision to that effect, but the proposal was
eventually defeated. Nevertheless, the chairman, Mr. Aaron Broches, stated that
“the tribunal would normally take compliance into account in its final award even
if this factor was not specifically addressed”.°° Current practice shows that ICSID
tribunals agree with the view that parties’ failure to abide by decisions on
provisional measures may — not shall, in line with the discretionary evaluations in
this area — be taken into account in the final decision.”’ Indeed, arbitral tribunals
may draw adverse inferences from non-compliance.’® Furthermore, they may
award costs and damages deriving from said non-compliance.

In Agip v. Congo, the Government decided not to comply with the provisional

measures.°” In its award on the merits, the arbitral tribunal took into account

“(c) that the Government did not comply with the decision of the Tribunal, dated 18
January 1979, as to the measures of preservation and as a consequence AGIP was unable

to have access to a certain number of documents which could have assisted it in

_ 60
presenting its case”’.

Finally, the arbitral tribunal awarded further damages due to Respondent’s
conduct. The possibility to draw adverse inferences is of utmost relevance in
proceedings where provisional measures are sought in order to preserve evidence,

as acorollary of the respect for the arbitration agreement. Adde ZIAD6 nota 134.

In MINE v. Guinea, the arbitral tribunal harshly warned Claimant by affirming

that “pursuant to Article 47 and the applicable ICSID regulations and rules, the
Tribunal will take into account in its award the effects of any non-compliance by
MINE with its recommendations”. °! After some hesitation, finally MINE
complied with the decision on provisional measures and caused the attachments it
had obtained in Belgium and Switzerland against Guinea to be lifted. However,
since those State court proceedings had provoked costs and damages, the tribunal
awarded a sum in compensation of these expenses, although it reduced the amount
by about one third due to the novelty of the relevant circumstances concerning

court-ordered provisional measures parallel to ICSID proceedings.

More recently, in City Oriente v. Ecuador the arbitral tribunal affirmed that “a
failure to comply with orders given to respondents by the tribunal in accordance
with Art. 47 will entail a violation of Art. 26 (the contractual obligation to submit

to ICSID jurisdiction) and engage respondent’s liability”.

In conclusion, the reactions against non-compliance with a decision on
provisional measures appear rudimentary and, to a certain extent, contradictory
with one of the substantive conditions for granting provisional measures, namely
necessity under either the Plama or the Burlington tests: indeed, unless we admit
the availability of punitive damages, post hoc award of damages for non-
compliance means that the provisional measure was not necessary to avoid
irreparable harm, or that monetary compensation is a mere sweetener, failing

It is submitted that the combination of two or more out of the four reasons for
complying with provisional measures presented above™ play a more significant
role on the addressee’s evaluation of its costs and benefits than a decision

awarding damages for non-compliance.

C. Possibility for the addressee to oppose tribunal-ordered provisional

measures

C. The addressee of a decision granting provisional measures against it will wish
to avoid their implementation. However, a fair and reasonable party understands
that a failure to comply therewith is not appropriate. The means of harmonising
these opposite concerns is to seek their revocation or modification. Indeed, Art.
39, paragraph 3, ICSID Arbitration Rules provides that the arbitral tribunal may at
any time modify or revoke its recommendations. Although it is not specified, it
can do so either proprio motu or — as it happens more frequently — upon
application of a party. The conditions for obtaining an amendment of the earlier
decision differ to a certain extent from those addressed in Chapter three
concerning provisional measures in general. Since they are not contained in the
applicable instruments, it is deemed necessary to refer to a recent decision which

arguably expresses the current status of this issue in ICSID arbitration.

In Lao Holding N.V. v. Laos, Respondent sought amendment of the provisional
measures order (hereafter referred to as “PMO”) preventing the Government from
modifying the status quo or aggravating the dispute between the parties while
arbitration proceedings were pending.” Respondent intended to conduct criminal
investigations against employees of Claimant for alleged bribery and corruption
of officials of the Government in connection with Claimant’s investment in the
country. Since said action would have altered the status quo agreed by the parties
and enshrined in the PMO, Respondent’s request and permission from the tribunal
were necessary. The hearing on the merits of the case was scheduled to
commence the following month, therefore the parties were in the phase of trial

preparation.

Respondent contended that it retained its sovereign right to conduct criminal

investigations which moreover were not part of the dispute before the arbitral

tribunal and thus did not affect the integrity of the proceedings, whereas Claimant
submitted that this attitude was part of a procedural strategy of evidence
collection® in order to take an unfair advantage in view of the arbitration

proceedings on the merits, in violation of the principle of equality of arms.°”

In its analysis, the arbitral tribunal first made a parallelism between a decision
granting provisional measures and a decision modifying or revoking the latter:
indeed, also in this instance it found in general terms that a tribunal adopts a new
provisional measure, provided that the substantive conditions of urgency and
necessity are satisfied.” It did not refer to the jurisdictional condition — namely
prima facie jurisdiction / fumus bonae iurisdictionis — and rightly so: as a matter
of fact, this condition has already been verified at the moment the provisional
measures whose modification/revocation are sought were issued, therefore its
reiteration would be senseless. Indeed, in this subsequent phase there are three

scenarios:

- the tribunal finally finds that it lacks jurisdiction: in this case, it renders a final

award, of course without the availability of provisional measures;

- the tribunal has not ruled yet upon its jurisdiction to decide the merits of the
case: since it has already positively considered the jurisdictional condition, there

would be no reason to depart therefrom until a final decision is rendered;

- the tribunal has already handed down a final decision establishing its

jurisdiction: a fortiori, the jurisdictional condition 1s satisfied.

In each of these three scenarios, it is evident that the jurisdictional condition to

law machinery to collect evidence on the eve of the June arbitration hearing to advance its defence

°7 Ibid., para. 32: “A criminal investigation, according to the Claimant, crosses the line between
the Government’s general concern about corruption and enters the forbidden territory of using the
process of the criminal law to obtain an unfair advantage in the arbitration proceedings over the
Claimant, aggravating the inequality of arms between the parties”.

270
Provisional Measures in International Investment Arbitration
Ph.D. Thesis — Federico Lenci

issue a decision modifying or revoking provisional measures exists.

Thereafter, the arbitral tribunal went on to address the substantive condition of the
link between the (modification or revocation of the) provisional measures
requested and the rights in dispute, confirming the Plama test discussed in chapter
three,’ whereby the rights whose protection is sought shall not necessarily
coincide with the rights in dispute (contrary to the Maffezini test), but nonetheless
they shall relate to the specific dispute before the arbitral tribunal.” In this
connection, while it acknowledged that criminal proceedings are not encompassed
by the arbitration agreement”! — thus preventing in principle the application of the

rule of ICSID exclusivity — the tribunal found that

“This general rule having been reaffirmed by the Tribunal, there are however a number of
exceptional circumstances in this case which lead the Tribunal to depart from the general
rule entitling a State to enforce on the national level its criminal laws. In particular, the
Tribunal is satisfied on the evidence that the primary purpose for which the Respondent
intends to use the powers of criminal investigation, at least in the first instance, is to
collect evidence for use at the arbitration, which, in the result, will undermine the

integrity of the arbitral process”.

In a nutshell, 1t considered the rule and its exception from the perspective of the
right to non-aggravation of the dispute, in this case protecting the innocent party
and maintaining the effect of the provisional measure granted. At the same time, it
is interesting to note that it confirmed the high threshold for the restraint on a

sovereign right to investigate crime to be imposed by an ICSID tribunal.”

Furthermore, the arbitral tribunal dismissed the application because it considered

that Respondent had not established the change of circumstances, which is a

condition for this type of requests to be successful.’”* This condition, unique
feature of the motion under comment, absorbs the classic substantive conditions
of necessity and urgency: it is not by chance that — after ruling upon the absence
of change of circumstances — the tribunal synthetically stated that Respondent had
failed to demonstrate the necessity and urgency for granting such a modification
of the PMO only one month before the merits hearing. The tribunal included, once
again ad abundantiam, a hint on the substantive condition of proportionality,
which is part of the condition of necessity.” The rationale for such an absorption
and preminence of the change-of-circumstances condition is logical: if no change
of circumstances has occurred between the decision granting provisional measures
and the moment of the ruling on motion to modify or revoke those measures, how

could modification or revocation be urgent and necessary?

In conclusion, a few words on the burden to demonstrate this fundamental
condition. In the case under comment, the tribunal stated that it is incumbent upon
the requesting party, namely the addressee of the decision on provisional
measures, to establish said change of circumstances.’ Actually, given the
tribunal’s proprio motu power to modify or revoke its recommendations at any
time, pursuant to Art. 39, paragraph 3, ICSID Arbitration Rules, one may
theoretically envisage a situation whereby, despite the requesting party’s failure to
satisfy this condition, the tribunal may evaluate the evidence already present in

the records and find that a sufficient change of circumstances has occurred.

™ Ruling on motion to amend the provisional measures order, para. 49: “What seems to have
happened is not so much a “change of circumstances” as a change of tactics as the arbitration
hearing date approached”. The tribunal noted at para. 43 that this condition was discussed in the

diversion and distraction of a full-scale criminal investigation landing on top of the ICSID
arbitration”.

Indeed, if the arbitral tribunal has the power to originate a modification and/or a
revocation of provisional measures on its own motion, a fortiori it has the power
to complement an unsteady request. However, this would be an extreme case,
since practice has indicated that arbitral tribunals never avail themselves of their
proprio motu power: they are wary and careful not to appear as partial in the eyes
of the parties, which may consider their actions as an excess of authority and a
pre-judgment of the case. The same reasoning and theoretical — so far —
construction is applicable to arbitration under the UNCITRAL Rules.’’ Such an
attitude is perhaps natural, however it is submitted that it may — at least in part —
derive from the relatively recent application of the norms concerning provisional

measures.

™ Art. 26, para. 5, 2010 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules provides that: “The arbitral tribunal may
modify, suspend or terminate an interim measure it has granted, upon application of any party or,
in exceptional circumstances and upon prior notice to the parties, on the arbitral tribunal’s own
initiative”. This provision is even more interesting, in consideration of the fact that in the
UNCITRAL framework arbitrators lack proprio motu power to issue provisional measures (see
Art. 26, para. 1).

CONCLUSION: THE ROLE OF CONSENT

Before concluding the present analysis, it is appropriate to devote these last lines
to some brief remarks on the impact of party autonomy on provisional measures
in the international investment framework. Indeed, this theme will arguably
constitute the basis upon which the development of our topic will be built in the
years to come.

The role of consent in this respect has already been evoked in various instances
throughout this thesis, since some of its manifestations have come to surface.’
Party autonomy is one of the cornerstones of international arbitration and, at the
same time, of the private international law system relating to contractual
obligations.” In relation to the latter aspect, it has been noted that the area of
contractual obligations — also as far as jurisdiction is concerned — is the first one
in which legislators showed their willingness to attribute value to party
autonomy. The two aspects are interrelated, since the expansion of party
autonomy as an instrument of regulating transnational’ relations also embraces
investor-State contracts.” This normative framework can play a role in shaping not

only the substantial elements of the underlying economic operation, but also the

' See Chapter two, B.II.vi, and Chapter three, section three.

* An example of this second aspect has recently been enshrined in EC Regulation no. 593/2008
(Rome I) of the European Parliament and of the Council, dated 17 June 2008, on the law
applicable to contractual obligations, whose point 11) states that “The parties' freedom to choose
the applicable law should be one of the cornerstones of the system of conflict-of-law rules in
matters of contractual obligations”: see Official Journal of the European Union, L 177/6, 4 July

* Some authors emphatically call them cosmopolitan, arguably referring to Kant’s classic
construction of this area on the minimum standard of treatment due to foreigners: see TORRES, A
afirmacdo do direito cosmopolita. Novas perspectivas do Direito internacional contempordneo, in
DIREITO, CANCADO TRINDADE, PEREIRA (org.), Estudos em homenagem ao Professor Celso D. de
Albuquerque Mello, Rio de Janeiro, 2008, 924; for one of the most recent and already authoritative
interpretations of Kant’s cosmopolitanism, see KLEINGELD, Kant and Cosmopolitanism: The

Provisional Measures in International Investment Arbitration
Ph.D. Thesis — Federico Lenci

procedural setting where the dispute settlement option allows the parties to tailor
it to their specific needs, as in the case of provisional measures. Sure enough,
these processes are more complex than purely inter-individual negotiations, due to
the sovereign nature (or political subdivision) of one of the parties. Moreover,
provisional measures in international investment arbitration are currently in a
relatively embryonic phase of development, in which arguably the necessity of
entering into specific provisions thereupon is not felt yet. However, the general
idea that parties are interested in more specific norms in relation to procedure has
already made its appearance: in this connection, BITs and MITs function as lex
specialis.°

The phenomenon of ¢reatification of provisional measures, arguably more
advanced than its counterpart in the contractual framework (namely, their
contractualisation) exists in the NAFTA and in the Model BITs of the United
States and Canada. In relation to the latter, negotiators acting on its behalf, on the
one side, and on behalf of the EU Commission, on the other, have recently
completed their work on the draft agreement which goes under the name of
“Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement” (CETA). It consists of a very
detailed body of norms which, in the intention of the parties, are designed to
tackle the main issues on trade, investment, sanitary and phytosanitary measures
and so forth, in order to enhance economic exchanges between Canada and the
EU. The consolidated CETA text was published on 26 September 2014 and still
has to be submitted to the EU Council and Parliament for ratification, following a
thorough review of its provisions.’ From a structural viewpoint, it resembles the
NAFTA and, in relation to our topic, it contains a specific provision on
provisional measures, thus treatifying them. Indeed, art. X.31 (“Interim Measures

of Protection”) provides that

Comparative Law Quarterly, 2008, 361.

Provisional Measures in International Investment Arbitration
Ph.D. Thesis — Federico Lenci

“A Tribunal may order an interim measure of protection to preserve the rights of a
disputing party or to ensure that the Tribunal’s jurisdiction is made fully effective,
including an order to preserve evidence in the possession or control of a disputing party
or to protect the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. A Tribunal may not order attachment nor may it
enjoin the application of the measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article
X.22 (Submission of a Claim to Arbitration). For the purposes of this Article, an order

includes a recommendation’.

This provision is of utmost relevance — even though the Draft Agreement is not
yet in force — since it indicates a trend which has already emerged in its American
predecessors and references: provisional measures can be ordered, thus solving
any arbitral and doctrinal controversy about their legal force, at least in this
context.

Due to the scarce quantitative presence of like provisions, said phenomenon of
incipient treatification is to be considered as an aspect of lex specialis, not yet as a
factor of consolidation of commonly accepted norms (customary international
law). In any manner, the passage from the first step — emergence — to the second —
consolidation — shall not be excluded: indeed, at this stage, nothing prevents us
from predicting that this kind of provisions will be reiterated in the upcoming
BITs and MITs, as one of the guarantees of a fair and effective arbitration. This
development will also generate the beneficial effect of guiding arbitral tribunals —
and State courts — even in cases were they are to apply different treaty
instruments, silent on the point of, respectively, the binding force of provisional
measures and their enforcement: instead of merely referring to case law, these
adjudicating organs will be able — and, perhaps, facilitated — in their task to verify
whether a given norm has consolidated in the international framework and to act
accordingly.

The contribution provided by treatification will undoubtedly be useful; even more
useful and interesting will be that of contractualisation, since in that second case
the parties to the agreement will coincide with the parties which will
prospectively arbitrate against one another. In this connection, the parties will be

able to tailor effectively the kind of provisional measures they want, the

277
Provisional Measures in International Investment Arbitration
Ph.D. Thesis — Federico Lenci

conditions to which their issuance is subject, their legal force, and so forth (thus
crystallising bargaining). In this manner, through the increase in legal security in
this respect, the investor-State contract will serve in greater depth its economic
function’ and raise the probability that the parties will cooperate, since they will
have a better picture of the scenario they will have to face in case of arbitration.
As a matter of fact, one has to bear in mind that the analysis made in Chapter
three on conditions, purposes and atypicalness of provisional measures 1s
applicable if parties do not agree otherwise: they constitute default rules. In case
of private ordering of this procedural mechanism, it will then be necessary to
evaluate on a case-by-case basis whether the parties exceed their autonomy,
drafting provisional measures which are null and void: as a matter of fact, there
exists a noyau dur of provisional measures which cannot be impaired, since
otherwise their very nature becomes distorted. By way of example, the parties will
undoubtedly be barred from providing that the tribunal may be empowered to
issue provisional measures even in case of complete lack of urgency.
Treatification and contractualisation of provisional measures will also be of
relevance in regard to the phase of their enforcement before State courts. Indeed,
State immunity from pre-judgment measures of constraint is extensive, meaning
that such measures are excluded unless the State against whose property or
possession the measures are to be issued has expressly consented to them by the
specified means provided for in art. 18 of the 2004 United Nations Convention on
State Immunity (UNCSI) or, alternatively, has allocated or earmarked the

property for the satisfaction of the claim which is object of the proceedings.’

® SALACUSE, The Three Laws of International Investment. National, Contractual and International
Frameworks for Foreign Capital, Oxford, 2014, 167: “From an economic point of view, an
investment contract is more than merely a statement of legal rights and duties. It also serves
important economic functions that are fundamental in achieving the purposes of the investment
and in assuring, the cooperation that is so necessary for economic activity”.
” Art. 18 UNCSI provides as follows: “No pre-judgment measures of constraint, such as
attachment or atrest, against property of a State may be taken in connection with a proceeding
before a court of another State unless and except to the extent that:
(a) the State has expressly consented to the taking of such measures as indicated:

(i) by international agreement;

(ii) by an arbitration agreement or in a written contract; or

(iii) by a declaration before the court or by a written communication after a dispute

between the parties has arisen; or

278
Provisional Measures in International Investment Arbitration
Ph.D. Thesis — Federico Lenci

Consequently, if the host State, in the quality of co-contractor with the
prospective foreign investor, specifies the assets out of which the latter, in case it
will be victorious in the provisional-measures phase, will be able to obtain
enforcement before the State court in which such assets are located, the overall
effectiveness of this procedural mechanism will undoubtedly be improved. Of
course, a provision to that effect will be inserted only if — and to the extent that —
such prospective foreign investor finds itself in a strong bargaining position, at
least in this embryonic phase, in which these provisions are very rare, if not
absent at all. Although the UNCSI is not yet in force, this provision “is probably
consonant with customary international law”."”

Only the future will tell if all or part of these predictions will prove to be true, so

that provisional measures will really prove to be the front teeth of international

investment arbitration.

(b) the State has allocated or earmarked property for the satisfaction of the clatm which is the
object of that proceeding”. The text of the Convention is available at the UN institutional website:
