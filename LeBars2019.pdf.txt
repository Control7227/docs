Sumunary: {tis current practice today for arbitral tnbunals to grant interim or
provisional measures in international investment arbitration. Efficiency and
impact of the measures are however largely debated in terms of legal grounds
to grant those measures and because they are not self-executing, due to the fact
that arbitral tribunals do not dispose of coercive power unlike state judge. This
power fo grant measures is then influenced by the will of the parties to respect the
orders, even if non-compliance with orders can influence the decision making of
the arbitrators in a final award.

In practice, the time between the commencement of investment arbitration and
the rendering of the final award can be rather long, and events occurring during
this time could threaten the conduct of the proceedings and render the final
award hollow. Interim measures may prove critical to preserving a party’s rights
pending the final award.

eficiéncia e o impacto das medidas sao, porém, largamente debatidas a respeito
do respectivo fundarnento legal e, tambérn, porque nao sdo auto-exequiveis,
devido ao facto de os tribunais arbitrais nao gozarem, ao contrario dos tribunais
estaduais, de poder coercivo. O poder para adoptar medidas cautelares ou
provisorias € influenciado, portanto, pela vontade das partes em respeitar as
medidas dos tribunais, mesmo se o desrespeito possa influenciar a decisao final
dos arbitros.

Na pratica, o tempo transcorrido entre o micio da arbitragem de investimento e
a prolacdo da decisdo final pode ser bastante longo e os eventos que decorrem
no entretanto podem amicacar o normal decurso do processo ou mesmo tornar
a sentenga indtil. As medidas provisdrias podem demonstrar-se criticas para
preservar 05 direitos de uma parte enquanto a decisdo final nao ¢ prolatada.

The authority of arbitral tribunals to grant interim or provisional measures in
international investment arbitration is today uncontested and represents current
practice’. However, their efficiency and impact are largely debated as provisional
measures are not self-executing. This is due to the fact that arbitral tribunals do
not dispose of imperium, i.e., coercive power, which distinguished them from
their state judges*. Their power to grant measures is therefore largely influenced
by the will of the parties to respect the orders, even if non-compliance with
orders can influence the decision making of the arbitrators in a final award. It
remains that interim measures can be of immense importance to parties involved
in investment arbitration proceedings and the recent reform proposed for the
ICSID Rules will generate additional debates.

In practice, the time between the commencement of investment arbitration and
the rendering of the final award can be rather long, and events occurring during
this time could threaten the conduct of the proceedings and render the final
award hollow. Interim measures may prove critical to preserving a party’s rights
pending the final award. Securing interim measures in investment arbitration
presents several particularities that arbitration practitioners have to familiarise
themselves with.

I. Jurisdiction to Order Interim Measures

All the major institutional rules provide for the granting of interim relief. The
rules surveyed here include rules commonly used in investment arbitration —
ICSID, ICSID Additional Facility (ICSID AF), UNCITRAL (both 1976 and
2010) and SCC — as well as the ICC Arbitration Rules and the recently released
SIAC Investment Rules.* All of the UNCITRAL 1976,4 UNCITRAL 2010,°

ICC,° SCC’ rules and the SIAC Investment Rules® expressly condition the grant
of interim relief on there being a request made by a party. Exceptionally, the
ICSID and ICSID AF Rules allow a tribunal to recommend interim measures
of its own initiative.? The ICSID AF Rules additionally specify that the tribunal
may recommend measures other than those requested.'°

All sets of rules examined also provide that parties may apply to national courts
for interim relief.'’ However, the ICSID Rules additionally require that the
parties must consent to recourse to national courts in order to be able to do so.”
This requirement of party consent was introduced in the 1984 amendments to the
ICSID Rules® to engineer compatibility between the interim measures regime
and the exclusive jurisdiction that an ICSID tribunal enjoys over a dispute
submitted to ICSID arbitration."

More generally, the parties’ freedom to have recourse to domestic interim relief
after the arbitration tribunal is constituted is often limited. The ICC Rules
stipulate that this may only be done in ‘appropriate circumstances’, while the
as yet untested SIAC Investment Rules require “exceptional circumstances’.
Such circumstances would exist when the tribunal is not in a position to provide
effective relief, for example, against third parties over which the tribunal has no

jurisdiction.

Of all the arbitration rules examined, only the ICSID and ICSID AF Rules
expressly require that the tribunal give each party an opportunity to be heard.’
The remaining rules surveyed are silent on the issue. However, ex parte relief
is probably not available in investment arbitration as this could amount to a
fundamental breach of procedural fairness, leaving the award vulnerable to being
set aside.

A different issue is whether tribunals have the power to issue orders maintaining
the status quo pending a response from the party against whom the request for
interim measures is submitted. The UNCITRAL Model Law expressly provides

for such a possibility,'? which is not uncommon in investment arbitration
practice, irrespective of the set of arbitration rules applicable. ’* In the Von Pezold
v. Zimbabwe case, the state ordered the claimants to allow an inspection of share
registers of all companies linked to the ICSID proceedings, which was to take
place two days later, and threatened criminal prosecution if the claimants refused
to comply. Immediately upon receiving the state’s letter, the claimants filed
a request for an order preventing such research. The president of the tribunal
ordered, one day later and without inviting the state’s comments, the requested
relief, '° highlighting that he would ‘confer with [the other arbitrators] as soon
as possible regarding the final determination of the Application, including the
need, if any, for reconsideration of these instructions’. This approach, that can
be understood based on the urgency of this specific matter, does not mean that
Tribunals can rule on their own without a proper debate. Acting differently is
dangerous for the validity of the final award and, in any case, the arbitrators have
to motivate precisely why they step one way or another, in order to avoid further
difficulties for the parties at the stage of enforcement.

Another difference between the various sets of rules is the availability of
emergency relief, or relief before the tribunal is constituted. Given the time-
sensitive circumstances under which most interim relief is commonly requested,
parties may require relief prior to the relatively lengthy process of constituting
the tribunal. Only the ICC, SCC and SIAC Investment Rules allow for emergency
relief.

As a matter of fact, there is some uncertainty as to whether emergency relief is
available in treaty-based investment arbitration conducted under the ICC Rules.
While the SIAC Investment Rules require the parties’ express consent before
the emergency provisions apply,”° and the SCC rules do not impose any separate
requirement of party consent, the ICC emergency arbitrator provisions require
both parties to be signatories to the arbitration agreement.”! Certain commentators
consider that this excludes treaty-based investment arbitration; given that the
state’s offer to arbitrate is contained in the treaty and is accepted by the investor’s
request for arbitration, there is no orthodox arbitration agreement.

Under the SCC and SIAC Investment Rules (but not the ICC Rules), emergency
orders granted cease to be binding if the dispute is not referred to a tribunal
within 90 days of their granting. This safeguards against abuse of the emergency
process by a party that has no intention of commencing arbitral proceedings.

Only the SCC provisions on emergency proceedings have been tested in

investment arbitration, with emergency relief granted in three reported cases.”
Two questions of note were answered by the emergency arbitrators in these
proceedings: (1) emergency relief could be granted even if the investment treaty
had been concluded before the introduction of the SCC emergency provisions; **
and (2) emergency relief could be granted notwithstanding the requirement of a
cooling-off period in an investment treaty.”

II. Conditions for the Granting of Interim Measures

The conditions for the granting of interim measures are generally not expressly set
out in the applicable arbitration rules. Indeed, the ICC and SCC Rules contain no
further indication than requiring that the arbitral tribunal grant only the measures
it ‘deems appropriate’.*° For its part, Article 47 of the ICSID Convention merely
states that ‘the Tribunal may, if it considers that the circumstances so require,
recommend any provisional measures which should be taken to preserve the
respective rights of either party,’?”? and Article 39 of the ICSID Rules does not
provide more details on the requirements that a request for interim measures
must meet: ‘the request shall specify the rights to be preserved, the measures the
recommendation of which is requested and the circumstances that require such
measures.’** This wording use the word ‘recommend’ has always lead to strong
debates regarding the binding or non-binding nature of the orders rendered, the
current discussions for the adoption of renewed INCID Rules does not seem to
clarify.

Only the UNCITRAL Rules 2010 expressly set out the preconditions for the
granting of interim measures, namely (1) the threat of a ‘harm not adequately
reparable by an award of damages’ (necessity), (2) that ‘substantially outweighs
the harm that is likely to result to the party against whom the measure is directed
if the measure is granted’ (proportionality), and (3) a ‘reasonable possibility
that the requesting party will succeed on the merits of the claim’ (prima facie
claim on the merits).*? These preconditions are also included in Article 17 of the
UNCITRAL Model Law.*°

Commentators and investment arbitration jurisprudence refer to most (or all)
of the following criteria for the granting of interim measures: (i) prima facie
jurisdiction; (ii) a prima facie claim on the merits; (iii) necessity; (iv) urgency;
and (v) proportionality.*!

i. Prima facie jurisdiction

Even though none of the rules examined provide for this condition, tribunals
often assess their prima facie jurisdiction before granting interim measures.”
The assessment is prima facie only, as requests for interim measures must be
dealt with as a matter of priority. Arbitrators are required to simply satisfy
themselves that they do not manifestly lack jurisdiction over the underlying
claim.’ ICSID tribunals can rely on the Secretary General’s registration of a
request for arbitration as a token of such prima facie jurisdiction, as he or she
would not do so where the dispute falls manifestly outside ICSID jurisdiction."
Accordingly, the granting of interim measures does not prejudge the tribunal’s
ultimate jurisdiction over the dispute, or preclude a jurisdictional challenge.

ii. Prima facie claim on the merits

Only the UNCITRAL Rules 2010 specifically require this precondition.
However, it has also been applied in arbitrations under other sets of rules.*> It is
not a stringent requirement, and the tribunal here needs only to assess a prima
facie review of the merits* to satisfy itself that the claims made are ‘not, on their

general dispute, but also that it has prima facie jurisdiction for the requested interim measures.’
(paragraph 216). In this regard, the tribunal found that it did not have prima facie jurisdiction to
suspend provisional measures that were related to the suspension of civil proceedings in third
states, i.c., states that were not parties to the BIT in question (para 226).

face, frivolously or obviously outside the competence of the [t]ribunal’.*’

iii. Necessity

One of the main criteria that arbitrators have to assess before ordering interim
measures is whether these measures are necessary to preserve the rights of one
of the parties to the arbitration.**

Two standards on the requisite level of necessity have emerged in international
arbitration practice. The higher standard is inspired by the International Court
of Justice, which in LaGrand interpreted necessity as the prospect of irreparable
harm.’ This standard was applied by the ICSID tribunal in Occidental v.
Ecuador, which considered that a provisional measure is necessary where the
actions of a party are ‘capable of causing or of threatening irreparable prejudice
to the rights invoked’.*° The claimant in Occidental v. Ecuador requested
provisional measures to compel Ecuador to fund and preserve a particular oil
field. The tribunal refused to grant the requested provisional measures on the
grounds that the relief sought was merely aimed at reducing the amount of
damages incurred by the claimant. Since the alleged harm was compensable by
monetary damages, provisional measures could not be granted.’ The tribunal
in Quiborax v. Bolivia acknowledged the ICJ jurisprudence, and, by referring
to Article 17A of the UNCITRAL Model Law (reproduced in the UNCITRAL
Rules 2010),” explained that irreparable harm is harm that cannot be repaid by
the award of damages.* This view was shared by the ICSID tribunal in Plama
v. Bulgaria. The dispute involved the decision by a Bulgarian district court that
had ordered that the company constituting the claimant’s investment in Bulgaria
be declared bankrupt, and that its assets be sold and distributed to its creditors.
The tribunal refused to order the discontinuance of the insolvency proceedings,
as it considered that, regardless of the outcome of the Bulgarian proceedings, the
claimant’s right to pursue its claim for damages in the ICSID arbitration and the
tribunal’s ability to decide this claim remained unaffected.

The lower standard requires merely that the applying party risk suffering
significant harm should the provisional measures not be granted. In Perenco v.
Ecuador, the tribunal considered that ‘where action by one party may cause loss
to the other which may not be capable of being made good by an eventual award
of damages, the test in [Article 47 of the ICSID Convention] is likely to be met.
But the Article does not lay down a test of irreparable loss and the authorities
do not warrant so narrow a construction.’* The tribunal ordered that Ecuador
refrain from collecting on certain taxes, because this would expose the claimant
to imminent seizure of its assets in Ecuador and bring the claimant’s business in
the country to an end.*°

In City Oriente v. Ecuador, the tribunal noted that ‘it is not so essential that
provisional measures be necessary to prevent irreparable harm, but that the
harm spared the petitioner by such measures must be significant and that it
exceeds greatly the damage caused to the party affected thereby.’*’ Therefore,
the City Oriente tribunal replaced the requirement of irreparable harm with a
proportionality element.

It is worth noting that the ICJ’s test in LaGrand was birthed in extreme
circumstances, in which provisional measures were sought to stay the execution
of a German national by the United States.* It is difficult to think of a more
acute situation of irreparable harm. Such situations are unlikely in investment
arbitration, and it is questionable whether this high threshold is adequate in that
specific field.”

iv. Urgency

Although not expressly required by the arbitration rules surveyed, urgency has
been referred to as ‘the most important (even a sine gua non) consideration

on the case at hand.

for the granting of interim measures’,*’ as provisional measures ‘will only be

appropriate where a question cannot await the outcome of the award on the
merits’.*! Thus, tribunals have regularly considered urgency as a requirement for
the granting of interim measures.*

In practice, urgency appears to be the assessment of necessity in the prevailing
circumstances.* This was well articulated by the tribunal in Perenco v. Ecuador:
‘[p]rovisional measures may only be granted where they are urgent, because
they cannot be necessary if, for the time being, there is no demonstrable need
for them’.™

The degree of urgency required before provisional measures should be granted
depends on the circumstances and nature of the measures sought.°> Typically,
urgency is related to the prospect of potential harm being caused to the applying
party before the final award is rendered by the tribunal.*° In any event, the applying
party is obliged to demonstrate that the threat to its interests is imminent and
likely to occur. Mere possibility or hypothetical harm are insufficient grounds
for such measures.*’

v. Proportionality

It is generally admitted that ‘the risk of harm must be assessed with respect to
the rights of either party.’** Most of the institutional arbitration rules are silent
on this requirement, except for Article 26 of the UNCITRAL Rules 2010, which
expressly requires that the harm the applicant is likely to suffer ‘substantially
outweighs the harm that is likely to result to the party against whom the measure

is directed if the measure is granted’.*°

This is akin to the common law doctrine of the ‘balance of convenience’, whereby
a tribunal must compare the harm that would result to either party if it turned out
at the stage of the final award that provisional measures were wrongly granted
or withheld.® Tribunals may consider proportionality either as a standalone
requirement! or, more commonly, as part of the requirement of necessity.”

Tribunals pay heightened attention to the requirement of proportionality when
potential impingement on the sovereign powers of a state is at stake. This is
particularly obvious in cases involving applications for the stay of domestic
criminal proceedings to protect the arbitral process. As the tribunal in Hydro
S.r.J vy. Albania considered, “criminal law and procedure are a most obvious
and undisputed part of a State’s sovereignty’ and, therefore, ‘any obstruction
of the investigation or prosecution of conduct that is reasonably suspected to be
criminal in nature should only be ordered where that is absolutely necessary’.
The tribunal granted the measures sought, reasoning that the state’s threat to
incarcerate the claimants would affect their ability to participate in the arbitration,
while a stay of the criminal proceedings would merely postpone the state’s ability
to bring those proceedings.“

The question of irreparable harm can be rather specific when one party requests
security for costs. This can occur when the petitioner will suffer an injury that is
“neither remote nor speculative but actual and imminent” and cannot be made
whole through monetary damages awarded at the end of the proceedings.® For
example one can cite the impossibility for one party to pay an award allocating
damages or even only costs due to the impecuniosity of the other party to the
arbitration.

III. Types of Measures Granted by Investment Tribunals

There is generally no restriction on the types of interim measures available for
the mere reason that the rules mostly use a very broad wording in order for
the Tribunals to get flexibility in their potential rulings. Practically speaking,
measures granted by tribunals are generally measures that: require the parties to
cooperate in the proceedings or preserve evidence, or decide on confidentiality”;
preserve the status quo between the parties and avoid further aggravation of
the dispute through unilateral action; prevent the parties from seeking relief
through other remedies, for example, by staying parallel proceedings; or secure
compliance with an eventual award, for example, by ordering security for costs.®

i. Measures to maintain the status quo and avoid further aggravation of the
dispute

The principle that a dispute should not be aggravated is part of general international
law.® It was the basis upon which Article 47 of the ICSID Convention (which
empowers the arbitral tribunal to grant interim relief) was drafted,® and has been
expressly acknowledged as a general obligation incumbent on disputing parties
by several ICSID tribunals.”

The preservation of the status quo or the non-aggravation of the dispute,
rather than being considered as a type of interim measure, may be considered
as a criterion for granting interim measures, which applies to several types of
measures. In practice, the preservation of the status quo or the non-aggravation
of the dispute has been used as a ground for a very wide range of applications for
relief, such as ordering the stay of proceedings in domestic courts,”’ preventing

66. This type of measures which can be found also in commercial arbitration and is broadly
aaccpted will not be discussed in details in this commentary.

the respondent from publicising criminal investigations,” or preserving disputed
contractual rights.”

This large scope of measures that fall under the preservation of the status quo
and non-aggravation of the dispute can be seen as contradicting the application
of the high threshold for the necessity criterion. But preventing aggravation of
a potential harm can also be analysed as avoiding aggravation of the dispute,
therefore leading to this criterion being neutralized as least partially for this type
of measures.

ii. Measures to stay parallel proceedings

Many international tribunals have granted interim measures directed at the
conduct of domestic courts.“ The most controversial variety of such measures
consists in injunctions against the state’s conduct of criminal proceedings against
the claimant.

States’ power to prosecute has regrettably been used against claimants in retaliation
for the commencement of arbitral proceedings, resulting in applications to the
arbitral tribunal for injunctive relief. On the other hand, tribunals are reluctant to
infringe on a core aspect of state sovereign power: the national judge’s ability to
initiate criminal proceedings.” Relief will only be granted where there is a clear
abuse of the criminal process, for example, where the criminal proceedings were
politically motivated, initiated as a ‘defence strategy’ to the arbitration,” or as
a means of compelling the claimant to comply with alleged obligations that are
disputed in the arbitration.” In most cases, the principle of separation of powers

when constitutionally protected limits the power of the arbitrators, specifically
when the criminal action was initiated totally or partially before the arbitration
started.

iii. Measures ordering security for costs

The SCC Arbitration Rules explicitly provide for the possibility for tribunals to
order security for costs.”* Security for costs can also be considered as provided for
under Article 26(2)(c) of the UNCITRAL Rules 2010, which refers to measures
that ‘provide a means of preserving assets out of which a subsequent award may
be satisfied’.”

The new version of the ICSID Rules seems to be opting fora new regime of security
for costs, independent from the set of rules applicable for interim measures®.
Although investment arbitration tribunals have generally acknowledged their
power to grant security for costs, even under other sets of rules,*! they are very
reluctant to grant such measures. Tribunals have referred to various reasons for
their refusals, including that it would be improper to prejudge the claimant’s
case,®*” or because there is no imminent harm at stake.®

page 507, at p. 528.

80. Under the structure of the proposed revised Rules, it appears that security for costs will
not be a type of provisional measure, as it is provided for in Rule 51, separated from Rule 50
dealing with provisional measures. It can also be noticed that, unlike proposed Rule 50, Rule 51
on security for costs uses the verb to “order”. This indicates that an order for security for cost
is binding. Indeed, the proposed Rule 51 provides arbitral tribunals with the power to sanction
a party that refuses to comply with such an order, by suspending or discontinuing the proceed-
ings. Similar sanctions (or any other sort of sanctions) do not exist under proposed Rule 50 in
relation to provisional measures. It can also be noted that while the initiative to order provision-
al measures may be either the parties’ or the tribunal’s, an order for security for cost can only be
rendered following a request submitted by one of the parties. Furthermore, the criteria tribunals
are asked to apply when considering a request for provisional measures is different from the
criteria applied when a request for security for cost is considered. In particular, a tribunal is
allowed to recommend provisional measures only if it considers it to be urgent and necessary
to do so. This is not required when a tribunal considers a request for security for costs. This
possible evolution of the Rules is to be monitored strictly in order to define more precisely the
boundaries between preliminary measures and security for costs. The impact of this reform on
other Rules of arbitration which mainly referred to security for costs as an interim measure can
also be considered.

Tribunals have stated that security for costs might be ordered in the most
extreme cases, such as where essential interests of either party stand in danger
of irreparable damage,™ or where abuse or serious misconduct is apparent.®
Financial difficulties and third-party funding do not constitute in themselves
exceptional circumstances justifying the granting of security for costs.* Neither
would the fact that the claimant investor is a “shell company’ without assets of
its own, as special purpose or joint venture vehicles are common in investment
making.®’

The tribunal in RSM Production Corporation v. Santa Lucia ordered the claimant
to provide security for the respondent’s costs, as it was satisfied that such
exceptional circumstances were met, highlighting that ‘the difference between
the present proceeding and previous ICSID arbitrations in which the request for
security for costs was in every case denied, is that in this case the circumstances

proceedings Eskosol was relying on a third-party funder that would not be bound by an award
on costs (paragraph 15-17). However, the tribunal rejected the respondent’s request, since Italy
did not demonstrate that a posting of security for costs was either necessary or urgent in the
circumstances (para. 37). The tribunal noted that it was not aware of any obligation on the
part of the funder to meet an eventual costs order against Ekosol, and that that the funder had
assisted Ekosol in obtaining insurance to satisfy an eventual costs order, for an amount higher
than the amount of security sought by Italy (para. 37). The tribunal refused Italy’s claim as, in
the circumstances, an order for security for costs would impose a disproportionate burden on
the claimant (paragraph 38).

request for security of costs on the fact that the claimants were allegedly shell companies with
nominal assets, and their indirect owner Mr Jacobs made material misrepresentations about
the companies’ experience, finances and capacity (paragraph 34).The tribunal rejected the re-
spondent’s claim, as it failed to demonstrate the existence of “exceptional circumstances’, as
required by the RSM v. Lucia tribunal for an order for security for costs (para. 62). The tribunal
noted, inter alia, that mere insufficiency of assets would not suffice for an order for security for
costs, but that “something more’ was required — this ‘something more’ was not demonstrated
by the respondent (para. 61).

which were brought forward in other proceedings occur cumulatively.’®
According to the tribunal, there was a material risk of non-compliance with a
cost award given the claimant’s non-compliance with cost awards in previous
proceedings that it had initiated,®° combined with a serious lack of financial
assets given that the claimant’s claim was financed by a third party.

RSM Production Corporation v. Santa Lucia paved the way for a more flexible
approach in complex cases where a party can demonstrate the impecuniosity
of a Claimant. In approaching security for costs, the CIArb Guidelines entitled
“Applications for Security for Costs” (the “CIArb Guidelines”) has relevant
citations for Tribunals consideration, namely (i) Article 1 (2) provides that “When
deciding whether to make an order for security for costs, arbitrators should take
into account the following matters: 1 — the prospects of success of the claim(s)
and defence(s) Article 2); 2 — the claimant’s ability to satisfy an adverse costs
award and the availability of the claimant’s assets for enforcement of an adverse
costs award (Article 3); and 3 — whether it is fair in all of the circumstances to
require one party to provide security for the other party’s costs (Article 4).””°

According to Redfern and O’ Leary, “there are three criteria that an international
arbitral tribunal should expect to be established before acceding to an
application for security for costs: first, that there is a reasonable possibility that
the requesting party will succeed in its defence to the claim; secondly, if the
requesting party does succeed in its defense, that it is likely to be awarded costs;
and thirdly, that there is a risk that those costs will not be paid unless some
form of security is ordered. If these criteria are established, then the tribunal
must consider whether it is fair and just in all the circumstances that the order
be made.”*' This element of fairness allows for the appropriate test to include a
‘reasonable possibility of success’. If one party can demonstrate that there is a
reasonable chance that a cost award will never be paid (for example, because the
agreement with a third party funder does not cover an adverse cost award or if it
can be demonstrated that one party was never a company with proper financial
capacity to pay) this element of reasonableness may be met.

IV. The Effeciency and Enforcement of Interim Measures

The ICSID Rules state that a tribunal may ‘recommend’ interim measures.” The
ICC and SIAC Investment Rules use the more imperative term ‘order’,” while

the remaining rules surveyed use more neutral terms such as ‘grant’ or ‘take’.™
Notwithstanding the difference in terminology, interim measures ordered in
investment arbitration are considered as binding on the parties.”

On the other hand, tribunals lack the coercive power of state courts, and have
limited ability to compel enforcement of the interim relief granted. The tribunal’s
own coercive powers extend only to costs sanctions, and the drawing of adverse
inferences against a party on matters of evidence. For example, an adverse
inference was drawn by the tribunal in AG/P v. Congo against the respondent for
failing to cooperate with orders to preserve evidence.”

There are examples of respondent states pre-empting orders for provisional
measures, by voluntarily undertaking to preserve certain rights for the claimant.
For example, the government in Vacuum Salt v. Ghana undertook that it
would not deny the claimant access to certain records requested. The tribunal
considered that this satisfied the claimant’s concerns expressed in its request for
provisional measures, and did not see the need to order relief.”’ Another example
is found in /talba v. Uruguay, where the claimant sought to restrain Uruguay’s
criminal investigations against two of the claimant’s witnesses. The government
of Uruguay undertook that these investigations would not impede the witnesses’
ability to participate in the claimant’s case and freely offer their testimony. The
tribunal was persuaded by these undertakings, inter alia, and declined to restrain
the investigations.”

On the other hand, and more particularly where anti-enforcement or anti-suit
injunctions regarding proceedings against the claiming investor are concerned,
there is an understandable difficulty with enforcing the interim measures, given
that a state’s sovereign rights are implicated. Reportedly, out of 10 orders granted
by ICSID tribunals between 2000 and 2010 for relief suspending domestic
litigation, only two were complied with.”

If measures of enforcement are required, the requesting party must resign itself
to turn to national courts for assistance. This can be a complicated exercise given

that international conventions, in particular the New York Convention,’ and

domestic rules typically only provide for the enforcement of awards and not
orders.

In this regard, in Chevron v. Ecuador, the tribunal re-issued interim measures
previously granted in procedural order in the form of an interim award,!”!
stating that such an award was ‘immediately final and binding’ upon the parties.
The relevant interim measures sought to preclude the state from enforcing an
anticipated judgment issued by an Ecuadorian court against the claimants. There
is a practice among certain national jurisdictions to refuse to enforce interim
orders as awards under the New York Convention 1958, no matter their title. !

On the other hand, jurisdictions that have adopted Articles 17H and 171 of
the UNCITRAL Model Law 1985 with the amendments of 2006, specifically
provide that interim measures issued by an arbitral tribunal are binding and
shall be enforced by a competent national court subject to specified grounds for
refusing such enforcement.
