famous example of a provision concerning conservatory or provisional measures is
Art. 41 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice,” which served as a model in
the drafting of Art. 47 of the ICSID Convention (History, Vol. II, pp. 668, 813).
Nevertheless, the mixed nature of ICSID proceedings, certain special features of
ICSID procedure, and the specific wording of this provision have given Art. 47 of the
Convention its own characteristics. The authority to issue provisional measures is also
provided for in other instruments governing international adjudication. These include
the 1958 International Law Commission Model Rules on Arbitral Procedure (Art. 20),°
the 2021 ICC Arbitration Rules (Art. 28), the 2017 SCC Arbitration Rules (Art. 37), the
2020 LCIA Arbitration Rules (Art. 25), the 2013 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules
(Art. 26), and the 1985 UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial
Arbitration (amended in 2006).*

The purpose of provisional measures is to induce behavior by the parties that is
conducive to a successful outcome of the proceedings, such as securing discovery of
evidence, preserving the parties’ rights, preventing self-help, safeguarding the award’s
eventual implementation, and generally keeping the peace. They have to be taken at a
time when the outcome of a dispute is still uncertain. Therefore, the Tribunal has to
strike a careful balance between the urgency of a request for provisional measures and
the need not to prejudge the merits of the case.

The drafting history of what eventually became Art. 47 shows considerable disagree-
ment. The Working Paper, the Preliminary Draft, and the First Draft (History, Vol. I,
p. 206) envisaged a much stronger wording, providing for binding measures including
the tribunals’ power to impose sanctions for non-compliance. These drafts encountered
considerable opposition, on issues such as the compatibility of provisional measures
with the law of the host State, whether provisional measures should be ‘recommended’
or ‘prescribed,’ the difficulty in enforcing provisional measures, and the proposal that
the Tribunal fix a penalty for non-compliance with such measures (History, Vol. II,
pp. 270, 338, 515-516, 523, 573, 655, 663, 812-814). At one point, a suggestion to
delete the Article entirely was put to a vote, but defeated (ibid., p. 814). The final
version represents a compromise between those who wanted powerful provisional
measures and those who found them unnecessary.

Provisional measures should be distinguished clearly from awards; the provisions of
Arts. 53 and 54 concerning the recognition and enforcement of awards do not apply to
provisional measures. Art. 47 should also be distinguished from another type of interim

circumstances so require, any provisional measures which ought to be taken to preserve the respective

rights of either party.’

new Chapter IV A to introduce a new legal regime regarding interim measures.

measure provided for by the Convention, namely the stay of enforcement of an award
pending a decision on its interpretation (Art. 50(2)), revision (Art. 51(4)), and annul-
ment (Art. 52(5)).

5 The provisions of Art. 52(4) of the Convention should also be noted; it states that
‘Articles 41-45, 48, 49, 53 and 54, and of Chapters VI and VII shall apply mutatis
mutandis to proceedings before the Committee.” This would appear to exclude the
possibility of Art. 47 being applicable in annulment proceedings. The ad hoc
Committee in Libananco v Turkey observed that there was ‘considerable support’ for
the view that committees cannot recommend provisional measures in relation to annul-
ment proceedings, although it did not resolve the question,° and the ad hoc Committee
in Nations Energy v Panama considered the power to be ‘possibly beyond the scope of
the Committee’s powers under Article 52.’’ Yet the ad hoc Committee in Commerce
Group v El Salvador held that it may ‘in the appropriate situation use its inherent
powers to order security for costs,’ which is a form of provisional measure.® The ad hoc
Committee in von Pezold and others v Zimbabwe and Border Timbers v Zimbabwe
noted that the parties agreed that it “would have, at the very least, an inherent power to
recommend provisional measures necessary to protect the integrity of the proceedings,’
but the ad hoc Committee found it unnecessary to rule on whether it could order
provisional measures, either as a matter of Art. 47 of the Convention and Rule 39 of
the ICSID Rules, or as a matter of its inherent powers” (see Art. 52, paras. 685-688).

6 The application of Art. 47 is set out in more detail in Arbitration Rule 39. Arbitration
Rule 39 was amended with effect on 10 April 2006 to allow a party seeking provisional
measures to introduce the request at any time after the institution of the arbitral
proceedings, even before the constitution of the tribunal. Accordingly, the first para-
graph was modified and a new paragraph 5 was inserted to provide for that eventuality.

7 Arbitration Rule 39, as amended in 2006, provides the procedural framework for
provisional measures; it states as follows:

Rule 39
Provisional Measures

(1) At any time after the institution of the proceeding, a party may request that
provisional measures for the preservation of its rights be recommended by the Tribunal.
The request shall specify the rights to be preserved, the measures the recommendation
of which is requested, and the circumstances that require such measures.

(2) The Tribunal shall give priority to the consideration of a request made pursuant to
paragraph (1).

(3) The Tribunal may also recommend provisional measures on its own initiative or
recommend measures other than those specified in a request. It may at any time modify
or revoke its recommendations.

Article 47 — Provisional Measures 1057

(4) The Tribunal shall only recommend provisional measures, or modify or revoke its
recommendations, after giving each party an opportunity of presenting its observations.

(5) If a party makes a request pursuant to paragraph (1) before the constitution of the
Tribunal, the Secretary-General shall, on the application of either party, fix time limits
for the parties to present observations on the request, so that the request and observa-
tions may be considered by the Tribunal promptly upon its constitution.

(6) Nothing in this Rule shall prevent the parties, provided that they have so
stipulated in the agreement recording their consent, from requesting any judicial or
other authority to order provisional measures, prior to or after the institution of the
proceeding, for the preservation of their respective rights and interests.

Paragraphs (2) to (4), as well as paragraph (6), are identical to Arbitration Rule 39 in 8
its previous version. Arbitration Rule 39 was amended in 2006 only to add paragraph
(5). Paragraph (6) of Rule 39 evidently deals with provisional measures ordered by
domestic courts or authorities. It is discussed in the context of Art. 26 (see Art. 26,
paras. 284-286).

Pursuant to Art. 46 of the Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules (see Art. 25, paras. 9
12-19) a tribunal may issue provisional measures under similar conditions. This provi-
sion was not amended to reflect the changes brought to Arbitration Rule 39 in 2006, as
Art. 46 of the Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules preserves the possibility of seeking
provisional measures from competent judicial authorities, regardless of the agreement
stipulating consent. Another important difference to the Convention is the fact that
under the Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules a party may request that provisional
measures be ‘ordered’ by the tribunal. But the tribunal may also ‘recommend’ provi-
sional measures on its own initiative.

Il. INTERPRETATION
A. ‘Except as the parties otherwise agree, ...’

Art. 47 is subject to exclusion or variation by the parties.'° The parties may agree to 10
exclude the possibility of provisional measures altogether or to limit the tribunal’s
power with respect to the circumstances under which they are to be recommended or
with respect to the types of measures which will be permissible.

The 1981 and 1993 versions of the Model Clauses do not cover agreements by the 11
parties on provisional measures.'! An earlier version of the Model Clauses’ offered the
parties a formula to exclude provisional measures:

XXVI. No Arbitral Tribunal constituted pursuant to this agreement shall, without the
special consent of the parties hereto, be empowered to recommend any provisional
measures before rendering its award.

10 A vote to delete this part of the Article in the course of the preparatory works was defeated, see History,
Vol IL, 815.

11 Clause 14 of the 1993 Model Clauses is directed at provisional or conservatory measures by a domestic
court or other authority and is dealt with elsewhere (see Art. 26, paras 289-290; Art. 55, paras 119-120).

1058 SCHREUER’S COMMENTARY ON THE ICSID CONVENTION

12 That earlier version also offered a formula whereby the parties agreed to comply with
provisional measures recommended by the Tribunal:

XXVII. The parties hereto agree to abide by and comply with any provisional
measures [unanimously] recommended by an Arbitral Tribunal constituted pursuant
to this agreement.

13 Some investment treaties contain specific provisions on provisional measures. For
instance, Art. 9.23(9) of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-
Pacific Partnership provides that:

A tribunal may order an interim measure of protection to preserve the rights of a
disputing party, or to ensure that the tribunal’s jurisdiction is made fully effective,
including an order to preserve evidence in the possession or control of a disputing party
or to protect the tribunal’s jurisdiction. A tribunal may not order attachment or enjoin
the application of a measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 9.19
(Submission of a Claim to Arbitration). For the purposes of this paragraph, an order
includes a recommendation.’*

14 To similar effect, Art. 8.34 of the European Union—Canada Comprehensive and
Economic Trade Agreement provides that:

A Tribunal may order an interim measure of protection to preserve the rights of a
disputing party or to ensure that the Tribunal’s jurisdiction is made fully effective,
including an order to preserve evidence in the possession or control of a disputing party
or to protect the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. The Tribunal shall not order attachment or
enjoin the application of the measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article
8.23. For the purposes of this Article, an order includes a recommendation.'*

B. ‘... the Tribunal may, ...’
1, The Initiative to Request Provisional Measures

15 The earlier drafts of what eventually became Art. 47 foresaw provisional measures
only ‘at the request of either party’ (History, Vol. I, p. 206). In the subsequent debates, it
was suggested that the tribunal be given this power, even without the request of a party
(History, Vol. I, pp. 268 ff., 422, 573 para. 70). The clause requiring a request from a
party was deleted in the First Draft. Arbitration Rule 39(3) makes it clear that the
tribunal may also recommend measures on its own initiative.'> Nevertheless, it is
obvious that the initiative will normally come from an interested party. Arbitration
Rule 39(1) specifically provides that a party may request provisional measures. In the

published cases in which tribunals have considered provisional measures, the initiative
has always come from one of the parties. In many of these cases, the request was made
by non-State claimants.'° In other cases, the request came from the respondent State.'”
In some cases, requests came from both parties.'*

2. The Right of the Parties to Be Heard

Despite the provisional nature of the measures, and the urgency that may be involved,
Arbitration Rule 39(4) directs that the tribunal may only recommend, modify, or revoke
provisional measures after giving each party an opportunity to present its observations.
The purpose of this requirement is to avoid surprises or unintentionally unfair dispos-
itions.'? In compliance with this requirement, ICSID tribunals customarily invite parties
to exchange written submissions and often hold oral hearings on the subject of provi-
sional measures.~° Failure to give the other party an opportunity to be heard will amount
to a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure in the sense of Art. 52(1)(d).
This may expose the resulting award to annulment (see Art. 52, paras. 363-393).

1060 SCHREUER’S COMMENTARY ON THE ICSID CONVENTION

3. The Tribunal’s Discretion

17 It is obvious that a tribunal, in recommending provisional measures, is not bound by
the parties’ submissions, but may recommend measures other than those specified in a
request. In a number of cases, requests for provisional measures were denied.*' In other
cases, even where the applications were granted, the tribunals sometimes recommended
provisional measures which departed from the requests.7*

18 Under Arbitration Rule 39(3), the tribunal may, at any time, modify or revoke
provisional measures if they are no longer required by the circumstances.

C. ‘... recommend any provisional measures .. .’
1, The Binding Nature of Provisional Measures

19 The binding nature of decisions on provisional measures was a central question in the
drafting history of Art. 47.°° The Working Paper, the Preliminary Draft, and the First
Draft foresaw the power of an ICSID tribunal to prescribe, rather than merely recom-
mend provisional measures (History, Vol. I, p. 206). This power was opposed especially
by the delegate from China, who objected to binding measures particularly against the
State party which might be unable to comply for reasons of ‘necessity on national
policy’ (History, Vol. II, pp. 515, 518, 655, 813). An idea to authorize the tribunal to
make ‘interim awards’ on provisional measures (ibid., pp. 516, 523) did not prevail.
Eventually, the word ‘prescribe’ was replaced by the word ‘recommend’ by a large
majority (ibid., pp. 814 ff).7*

20 The Convention’s legislative history suggests that a conscious decision was made not
to grant the tribunal the power to order binding provisional measures. However, this
lack of binding force would not deprive them of all legal relevance. The general
obligation not to frustrate the object of the proceedings will in many cases amount to
an obligation to abide by provisional measures that are necessary to complete the
arbitration successfully. Moreover, the tribunal has the power to take the parties’

431, 440 ff.

24 The binding nature of provisional measures issued by other judicial bodies varies. The relevant instru-
ments (see para 1 supra) variously use the expressions ‘indicate,’ ‘order,’ ‘prescribe,’ and ‘interim award.’

conduct into account when making the award (see paras. 45-51 infra), the binding force
of which is beyond doubt.

Despite the apparently clear restriction to ‘recommendations,’ tribunals have
developed a doctrine under which provisional measures have binding effect on the
parties. In Maffezini v Spain, the Tribunal noted that the difference between the word
‘recommend’ used in Arbitration Rule 39, and the word ‘order’ used elsewhere in the
Rules to indicate a tribunal’s power to direct a party to undertake a certain action, is
‘more apparent than real.’ The Maffezini tribunal went on to state that its authority to
rule on provisional measures was ‘no less binding than that of a final award’ and hence
concluded that it deemed ‘the word “recommend” to be of equivalent value to the word
“order”.’?°

In Pey Casado v Chile, the Tribunal relied on Maffezini for its conclusion that the
question of the binding nature of provisional measures is no longer controversial. The
Tribunal also drew an analogy with the case law of the International Court of Justice
(ICJ) on the interpretation of Art. 41 of the ICJ Statute and with the case law of the Iran—
United States Claims Tribunal. The Tribunal referred to ‘the questionable method of
interpretation which consists of referring to the travaux préparatoires.’”® It did not
discuss the difference between the terms ‘indicate’ in Art. 41 of the ICJ Statute and
‘recommend’ in Art. 47 of the ICSID Convention though. In terms of the methods of
treaty interpretation, the Tribunal concentrated on the provision’s object and purpose,
rather than on its ordinary meaning.

In Tokios Tokelés v Ukraine, the Tribunal unquestioningly accepted the binding force
of provisional measures. The Tribunal said:

It is to be recalled that, according to a well-established principle laid down by the
jurisprudence of the ICSID tribunals, provisional measures ‘recommended’ by an
ICSID tribunal are legally compulsory; they are in effect ‘ordered’ by the tribunal,
and the parties are under a legal obligation to comply with them.’

Similarly, in Occidental v Ecuador, the Tribunal had no doubt about its power to
order binding provisional measures:

The Tribunal wishes to make clear for the avoidance of doubt that, although Article
47 of the ICSID Convention uses the word ‘recommend,’ the Tribunal is, in fact,
empowered to order provisional measures. This has been recognized by numerous
international tribunals, among them the ICSID tribunal in the Tokios Tokelés case.”*

In Biwater Gauff v Tanzania, the Tribunal both recommended and ordered certain
measures following Biwater’s applications for provisional measures. The Tribunal
‘recommended’ the preservation of evidence and the procurement of an inventory of
documents.”” By contrast, the Tribunal ‘ordered’ the production of certain documents.

1062 SCHREUER’S COMMENTARY ON THE ICSID CONVENTION

However, the Tribunal emphasized that it made the order for the production of docu-
ments not under Art. 47, but under Art. 43 of the Convention.°?

The Tribunal in Perenco v Ecuador reviewed the practice of a number of inter-
national courts and tribunals, and concluded that it was ‘generally accepted that provi-
sional measures are tantamount to orders, and are binding on the party to which they are
directed,’ irrespective of the use of the term ‘recommend,’*!

The Tribunal in Caratube v Kazakhstan emphasized, however, that ‘according to
Rule 39, the Tribunal cannot order, but can only recommend provisional measures in
ICSID proceedings.’** The Caratube tribunal also noted that it was not evident how far
arbitral awards were ‘of determinative relevance to the Tribunal’s task.’*?

In Tethyan Copper v Pakistan, the Tribunal observed that it was ‘generally recog-
nized that arbitral tribunals are empowered under these provisions to order provisional
measures with binding force and that the parties are obliged to comply with such
orders,’ and it added that the Parties had ‘not contested the binding nature of provisional
measures.’**

In PNG Sustainable Development v Papua New Guinea, the Tribunal came to the
same conclusion, finding that:

Despite the use of the term ‘recommend’ in Article 47 of the ICSID Convention, this
provision of the Convention has properly been understood as allowing the Tribunal to
order provisional measures. The phrase ‘recommend,’ in the context of the Convention,
means ‘order’ or ‘direct.’ An arbitral tribunal constituted under the ICSID Convention
has the power not merely to propose or urge provisional measures, but also to issue
orders mandating that such measures be taken.”

In Quiborax v Bolivia, the Tribunal considered whether the Respondent’s non-
compliance with its Decision on Provisional Measures was a breach of Art. 47 of the
Convention.*° Consistent with the jurisprudence of the ICJ and the European Court of
Human Rights, the Tribunal held that the view that provisional measures were ‘not
merely optional recommendations,’ but were binding on the parties, such that non-
compliance amounted to a violation of Art. 47,37 However, the Tribunal held that this
did not mean that Bolivia had breached its obligation to arbitrate in good faith:

That being said, given the text of Article 47 and the relatively recent evolution of
international law with respect to its interpretation, the Tribunal does not find that the
Respondent’s failure to comply with the Decision on Provisional Measures amounts to
a breach of its duty to arbitrate in good faith. Bolivia may not have been aware of the
binding nature of these provisional measures when it failed to comply with them. In
addition, as discussed further below, the Tribunal finds that the underlying right that
these measures sought to protect — the right to the procedural integrity of the arbitration

proceedings — was ultimately not impaired. As a result, although the Respondent
breached Article 47 by failing to comply with the provisional measures, under the facts
of this case this breach did not entail a violation of the duty to arbitrate in good faith.**

In United Utilities v Estonia, the Tribunal agreed with this line of decisions, observ-
ing that ‘lest there be any doubt in respect of this question, the Tribunal considers that it
has the authority to order, not merely to “recommend”, provisional measures. This has
been recognised by many ICSID tribunals.’*°

In RSM v St Lucia, the ad hoc Committee considered whether the Tribunal had
committed a manifest excess of powers within the meaning of Art. 52(1)(b) by having
‘ordered’ a provisional measure, whereas it should have merely ‘recommended’ such a
measure.*” The ad hoc Committee approached this issue not by reference to whether
provisional measures were ‘binding,’ but rather by considering whether any conse-
quences attached to non-compliance with provisional measures under Art. 47.*! The
Committee held that an order for provisional measures could not be enforced in the way
that an award can be enforced under Art. 54, but this did ‘not mean that it is not binding
in the sense that consequences can flow from non-compliance with a provisional
measure.”*”

As appears from the foregoing, there is now almost universal acceptance that provi-
sional measures under Art. 47 of the Convention have binding force. There is much
force in the argument that ICSID tribunals must have the ability to issue orders, inter
alia, to protect the integrity of the proceedings and to preserve their jurisdiction to
decide the merits of the dispute; in order to do so, provisional measures must be binding
on the parties.

2. The Implementation of Provisional Measures

As long as the draft of what eventually became Art. 47 still provided for provisional
measures to be ‘prescribed,’ there was also some debate about their enforcement
(History, Vol. II, pp. 338, 347). Even those who favored only non-binding measures
agreed that damages would be due in case of non-compliance (ibid., pp. 515 ff., 523).
The suggestion to render provisional measures in the form of interim awards (ibid.,
p. 516) would have led to their treatment like final awards for purposes of enforcement
(ibid., pp. 523, 573). At one point, a second paragraph was added into the First Draft
providing: “The Tribunal may fix a penalty for failure to comply with such provisional
measures’ (History, Vol. I, p. 206; Vol. II, pp. 655, 664). The idea was to include the
penalty in the final award (History, Vol. II, pp. 812 ff.). The second paragraph providing
for a penalty for non-compliance was eventually deleted by a ‘nearly unanimous vote’
(ibid., p. 815).

There was also some debate on the role of domestic courts to enforce provisional
measures emanating from ICSID arbitrations (History, Vol. II, pp. 338, 812). Mr.
Broches pointed out that there was no way for a private investor to obtain their specific

enforcement against the State (ibid., p. 516). Some delegates envisaged difficulties
where a provisional measure might conflict with the municipal law, especially the
constitutional law of the country where it should be carried out (ibid., pp. 270, 515,
573, 813, 814). These difficulties were removed when the tribunal’s power was
restricted to recommending provisional measures (ibid., p. 815).

36 It is uncertain whether a domestic court could be induced to enforce a provisional
measure by an ICSID tribunal that is only couched in the form of a recommendation.”
The obligation on Contracting States to the ICSID Convention is to recognize ‘an
award’ as binding, and to enforce the pecuniary obligations imposed by that award as
if it were a final judgment of a court in that State (see Art. 54(1)).*

37 The cases in which domestic courts have played a role in the context of ICSID
provisional measures concerned not the enforcement of the provisional measures, but
rather with ICSID provisional measures being directed against action taken in domestic
courts. The recommendations given by the ICSID tribunals seem to have exerted some
influence on the courts in deciding on the propriety of attachments that were contested
before them.

38 In MINE v Guinea, the ICSID tribunal, in its Ruling on Provisional Measures of
4 December 1985, had unequivocally recommended the discontinuation of all proceed-
ings in domestic courts.*° The Court of First Instance of Geneva cited the Tribunal’s
recommendation at length,“° and took it into consideration as one of several grounds
supporting its decision to lift the attachments. An application by MINE to the
Supervisory Authority of the Office des Poursuites for the Enforcement of Debts and
Bankruptcy in Geneva to have the attachments maintained was unsuccessful. The
Supervisory Authority also cited the Tribunal’s recommendation on provisional meas-
ures.”’ In rejecting MINE’s application, it said:

We know not only that the Arbitral Tribunal did not authorize recourse to such
measures but that, on the contrary, it recommended to MINE, in its decision on
provisional measures of 4 December 1985, that it should withdraw and permanently
discontinue all pending litigation before national courts as well as withdraw all other
provisional measures.*®

39 These Swiss decisions illustrate the fact that, while domestic courts may not be in a
position to enforce ICSID provisional measures, they can be strongly influenced by
them in situations where the exclusive jurisdiction of ICSID vis-a-vis domestic courts is
at issue.

40 In CSOB v Slovakia, the Tribunal, in its Procedural Order of 11 January 1999, had
recommended the suspension of domestic bankruptcy proceedings to the extent that

43 The decision of the Court of Appeal of Rennes of 26 October 1984 in Guinea v Atlantic Triton, (1995)
3 ICSID Reports 3, 9, contains a brief reference to the necessity for the parties to have recourse to national
courts for the implementation of conservatory measures recommended by an ICSID tribunal.

these proceedings might involve the determinations of issues before the Tribunal.*? The
Supreme Court of the Slovak Republic, in a ruling of 23 September 1999, upheld a
decision of the Bratislava Regional Court denying the request for suspension of the
bankruptcy proceedings. The Slovak Supreme Court found that there was no conflict
between the two proceedings and that the decision of the ICSID tribunal would be valid
and binding notwithstanding the results of the bankruptcy proceedings. The Tribunal’s
subsequent Procedural Order of 1 March 2000 reaffirmed and extended its earlier
recommendation of provisional measures.”°

In Zhinvali v Georgia, the Tribunal granted provisional measures directing that a
Georgia court stay and suspend proceedings insofar as they concerned issues pending
before the ICSID tribunal.°’ The Tribunal directed the Respondent to bring its recom-
mendation to the attention of the Georgia court so that it might take the exclusive
jurisdiction of ICSID into account.°? An earlier decision by a Georgia court that had
interfered with the Tribunal’s jurisdiction was subsequently vacated.°*

In Nova Group v Romania (see paras. 81, 187-190, 241 infra), the Claimants sought
provisional measures requiring Romania to, among other things, suspend all criminal
proceedings relating to the arbitration, to refrain from initiating any other proceedings
against the officers of its investment companies, and to withdraw an arrest warrant and
extradition request that had been submitted to the United Kingdom in respect of one
such officer.”

The Nova Group tribunal denied the majority of the Claimant’s requests for provi-
sional measures other than its request that Romania withdraw the European arrest
warrant and extradition request until the arbitration was complete.°> Romania did not,
however, withdraw the extradition request. Before the Westminster Magistrates’ Court,
the District Judge issued a judgment giving effect to the European arrest warrant in
respect of the person whose extradition was requested (namely, the sole director of
Nova Group Investments BV, the Claimant in the ICSID proceedings).°© An application
was made to the England and Wales High Court seeking permission to appeal the
judgment of the District Judge, including on the ground of abuse of process.®’ The
appellant argued that the District Judge had been wrong to order extradition, and argued
that the District Judge had erred in finding that the Nova Group tribunal’s Procedural
Order No 7 ‘was not binding on the Magistrates’ Court.’°* The High Court did not grant
the appellant permission to appeal on this ground.>? It held that the ICSID tribunal’s
provisional measures order ‘could not oust the extradition process’ which was being
pursued ‘under well-established machinery with origins in EU law,’ and which was
implemented in the Extradition Act 2003 of the United Kingdom. The High Court held

that enforcement of the Procedural Order No 7 was ‘a matter for the ICSID tribunal
when it gives its final award (which it has not yet done) and not for the Magistrates’
Court.’

3. The Consequences of Non-Compliance with Provisional Measures

44 The legislative history of Art. 47 contains repeated references to the tribunals’ power
to award damages to the aggrieved party where the other party had not complied with
provisional measures (History, Vol. II, pp. 515 ff, 655, 664, 813 ff.). At one point, a
suggestion to add a provision to the effect that ‘the Tribunal shall take into account in its
award the consequence of a failure to comply with the provisional measures’ was put to
a vote. This proposal was defeated, but the Chairman immediately announced that “he
assumed the majority was opposed to any specific mention of the effect of non-
compliance with the recommendation, but that naturally the Tribunal would normally
have to take account of this fact when it came to make its award’ (ibid., p. 815). This
announcement remained unopposed.

45 The idea that an ICSID tribunal would take the effects of non-compliance with its
recommendations into account in its award was later repeated in Note B to Arbitration
Rule 39 of 1968.°! It has also been supported by several authors.°

46 The cases in which provisional measures were ordered tend to support this sugges-
tion. In Holiday Inns v Morocco, the measures recommended were so vague that it is
difficult to say whether they were complied with. Nevertheless, Lalive interprets them
as a ‘discreet warning ... to both parties that the Tribunal could and would take notice
of any disregard of its recommendations.’®*

47 In AGIP v Congo, the Government clearly did not comply with the interim meas-
ures.°* It persisted in its refusal despite the fact that, in the course of the proceedings, the
Tribunal had ‘decided to invite the Government to comply with the Tribunal’s decision
of 18 January 1979 as to the measures of preservation.’® In its decision on the merits,
the Tribunal, in examining the grievances invoked by the Claimant, and in assessing the
reparation for the damage caused to it, took into account:

that the Government did not comply with the decision of the Tribunal, dated 18 January

1979, as to the measures of preservation and as a consequence AGIP was unable to have

access to a certain number of documents which could have assisted it in presenting its
66

case.

48 In MINE v Guinea, the Tribunal had expressed a warning to the Claimant in its
Decision on Provisional Measures of 4 December 1985 that ‘the Tribunal would take
into account in its award the effects of any non-compliance by MINE with its

recommendations.’°’ MINE was hesitant to comply, but did so eventually. In the
proceedings on the merits, Guinea’s counterclaim included legal expenses resulting
from non-compliance with the Tribunal’s recommendation. The Tribunal awarded
damages for costs and legal fees relating to the attachment proceedings in Belgium
and Switzerland, but reduced the amount requested by about one-third. Guinea’s lack of
response to prior proceedings, the situation created by a further decision of a US Court
of Appeals (see Art. 26, paras. 9-12), and ‘the lack of precedent for the Tribunal’s order
to discontinue the European attachments’ were seen to excuse MINE somewhat.®*

In addition to taking account of compliance with provisional measures, ICSID
tribunals have consistently been willing to take account of compliance with other
procedural orders and standards (such as the parties’ conduct) through their decisions
on the imposition of costs.°? For instance, in PNG Sustainable Development v Papua
New Guinea, the Tribunal observed that one of the factors to be taken into account in
deciding on the allocation of costs was ‘the existence of special reasons or circum-
stances,’ such as, for example, ‘procedural misconduct, the existence of a frivolous
claim, or an abuse of the [investment arbitration] process or of the international invest-
ment protection regime.’’° In that case, the Tribunal did not find ‘any evidence of
“special circumstances” or procedural misbehavior by either Party that would influence
the Tribunal’s decision on the allocation of costs.’”!

As noted above, the Tribunal in Quiborax v Bolivia considered whether the
Respondent’s non-compliance with its Decision on Provisional Measures was a breach
of Art. 47 of the Convention.’* It held that provisional measures were ‘not merely
optional recommendations,’ but were binding on the parties such that non-compliance
amounted to a violation of Art. 47.’> However, this breach had no cost consequences for
the Claimant.

In Tethyan Copper v Pakistan, the Tribunal held that procedural conduct which
results in a ‘significant increase of costs on both sides, without there being a justification
for such costs from an objective point of view, may also be taken into account in
determining the final allocation of costs.’’* This is consistent with the observation of
commentators who have noted that ICSID tribunals have ‘demonstrated their willing-
ness to regulate compliance with procedural orders and other standards through the
imposition of costs.’

4. Priority and Speed

The provisional nature of interim measures is closely linked to the urgency of the
situation. The measures must receive priority attention and must be taken with due
speed. At the same time, they are temporary in nature and subject to change and

withdrawal, as the circumstances may require. Most importantly, they must not be seen
to prejudge any questions of jurisdiction or of the merits that are still pending before
the tribunal.

53 Under Arbitration Rule 39(1), as amended in April 2006, a party may request
provisional measures at any time after the institution of the proceeding. Pursuant to
Rule 39(5), which was inserted in April 2006, if the request is made before the consti-
tution of the tribunal, the Secretary-General of ICSID, on the application of either party,
fixes time limits for the parties to submit observations on the request for provisional
measures, which will be considered by the tribunal as soon as it is constituted.’° If a
request for provisional measures is introduced before the tribunal has been constituted,
it can be considered by the tribunal without delay on the basis of the request itself and
any observations that may have been filed in accordance with Rule 39(5).””

54 Under Arbitration Rule 39(2), the tribunal shall give priority to a request for provi-
sional measures. Speedy action may require special procedures. The procedure may be
accelerated by convening a special session of the tribunal. In accordance with
Arbitration Rule 16(2), the tribunal may also take a decision by correspondence among
its members, provided that all of them are consulted.’* Even under this expedited
procedure, Arbitration Rule 39(4) requires that both parties must be heard before
provisional measures are taken.

55 The practice of ICSID tribunals shows that requests for provisional measures may be
disposed of with reasonable speed, although there are considerable variations in the time
it takes from an application to a decision.

56 A majority of ICSID tribunals have rendered a decision on a request for provisional
measures within a few months of the application being made.’” This trend has been

76 An interesting example of an effective and rapid disposal of provisional measures before the constitution
of an arbitral tribunal is provided by the practice of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea
(ITLOS), established by the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (opened for signature 10 December
1982, entered into force 16 November 1994) (1982) 21 ILM 1261 (UNCLOS). Pursuant to Art. 290 of
UNCLOS, ITLOS can consider and may prescribe provisional measures, following a party’s request,
pending the constitution of an Annex VII arbitral tribunal, eg an ad hoc tribunal selected by the parties as
the preferred means of dispute resolution under Art. 287 UNCLOS. The Tribunal has done so in several
cases, see Southern Bluefin Tuna (Australia and New Zealand v Japan) (Provisional Measures, Order of
27 August 1999) ITLOS Reports 1999, 280; Mox Plant (Ireland v United Kingdom) (Provisional

79 For example, in CSOB v Slovakia, several requests were made between 6 October 1997, 5 January 1999,

14 July 2003, and the decision was given on 6 August 2003; see Azurix v Argentina, Award (14 July
2006) paras 11-13. In Tokios Tokelés v Ukraine, Procedural Order No 1 (1 July 2003), the request was
made on 3 June 2003, and the Tribunal’s Order was rendered on 1 July 2003. In Plama v Bulgaria,

observed from the first ICSID arbitration in Holiday Inns v Morocco, where the request
was made on 12 May 1972, and a decision was given on 2 July 1972.%°

However, in several cases, tribunals have taken longer to render a decision on a
request for provisional measures.*! In SGS v Pakistan, for instance, SGS introduced its
request on 7 May 2002 and the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No. 2 on
16 October 2002.*” In PNG Sustainable Development v Papua New Guinea, the request
for provisional measures was made on 14 July 2014, and the Tribunal issued its decision
on 21 January 2015.*° In Herzig v Turkmenistan, the Respondent’s request for provi-
sional measures was filed on 20 August 2019, and granted by the Tribunal on
27 January 2020."*

Very rarely have tribunals taken significantly longer, and sometimes more than a
year, to render a decision on a request for provisional measures. In Maffezini v Spain,
the Respondent’s request was filed on 3 July 1998 and the Tribunal issued its

v IPTL, the Respondent filed its request for provisional measures on 28 June 1999 and
the Tribunal rendered its decision on 20 December 1999.°°

Exceptionally, in Pey Casado v Chile, the Tribunal took a little over two years to
render its decision on a request for provisional measures. Both parties had requested
provisional measures, the Respondent on 13 September 1999, and the Claimants on
23 April 2001. On 10 May 2001 the Tribunal invited the parties to give their views
on the requests for provisional measures. Written submissions were filed by the
parties on 17 and 21 May 2001 and were followed by a hearing on 21 June 2001.
The decision of the Tribunal was rendered on 25 September 2001.°”

In certain cases, the delay in rendering a decision has been justified due to particular
procedural developments. In MINE v Guinea, for instance, the request was made on
25 June 1985, and the decision was given on 4 December 1985, as the Tribunal on

(24 November 2014), the Claimant made its request for provisional measures on 15 September 2014, and
the Tribunal issued its Decision on 24 November 2014. In Lighthouse Corp v Timor-Leste, Procedural
Order No 2 (13 February 2016), the Respondent made its request for provisional measures on 18 October
2015, and the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 2 (which concerned the request for provisional
measures) on 13 February 2016.

1070 SCHREUER’S COMMENTARY ON THE ICSID CONVENTION

3 July 1985 initially denied the request as premature and Guinea on 8 August 1985 sub-
mitted a request for reconsideration.** In Saipem v Bangladesh, the Claimant introduced
a request for provisional measures with the request for arbitration of 5 October 2004,
but the parties subsequently agreed that a decision be deferred until after the hearing on
jurisdiction. The decision on provisional measures was rendered on 21 March 2007,
together with the decision on jurisdiction.*’ In Occidental v Ecuador, Occidental first
introduced its request for provisional measures with the Request for Arbitration on
17 May 2006 and then reiterated it in a separate application on 18 October 2006. The
request was significantly amended during the hearing on provisional measures held on
2-3 May 2007. The Tribunal’s Decision was rendered on 17 August 2007.”°

61 In Hela Schwarz v China, the Claimant filed a request for provisional measures on
4 December 2017, before the constitution of the Tribunal. The Tribunal issued its
decision on provisional measures on 10 August 2018, although the Tribunal’s decision
rejecting the Claimant’s application had been communicated to the parties in summary
form by letter dated 10 April 2018.7!

5. Provisional Measures and Jurisdiction

62 Giving priority to a request for provisional measures means that it has to take
precedence over any other issues pending before the tribunal. Where a party has raised
jurisdictional objections, the tribunal may have to decide on provisional measures
before having ruled on its own jurisdiction. As a consequence, a party may be exposed
to provisional measures, even though it is contesting the jurisdiction of an ICSID
tribunal. On the other hand, the urgency of the matter often makes it impossible to
defer provisional measures until the tribunal’s jurisdiction has been fully argued
and decided.

63 This question has arisen frequently before other arbitral tribunals and before the
ICJ.°? The case law of the ICJ has adopted the approach that a prima facie showing of
jurisdiction is sufficient to establish its power to indicate provisional measures. As held
in the Judgment in Alleged Violations of the 1955 Treaty of Amity, Economic Relations,
and Consular Rights (Iran v United States):

The Court may indicate provisional measures only if the provisions relied on by the
Applicant appear, prima facie, to afford a basis on which its jurisdiction could be

founded, but need not satisfy itself in a definitive manner that it has jurisdiction as
regards the merits of the case.”°

The Convention has a special feature, which is helpful in this regard. Art. 36(3) of the
Convention provides that the Secretary-General shall register a request for arbitration,
unless he or she finds that the dispute is manifestly outside the jurisdiction of the Centre.
Therefore, unlike in other procedures, such as in State-to-State cases brought before the
ICJ, there is a preliminary examination of jurisdiction before the case even reaches the
tribunal. Although the tribunal is, of course, in no way bound by this preliminary
examination of jurisdiction, it provides a useful basis for its power to recommend
provisional measures.“ The Secretary-General’s registration of a request, in accordance
with Art. 36(3) of the Convention, does not preclude the tribunal from examining the
question of jurisdiction before recommending provisional measures. It is equally clear
that a party may continue to challenge the jurisdiction after provisional measures have
been recommended, until the tribunal has formally decided on its competence (see
Art. 41, paras. 17-24). It is ultimately with the tribunal whether it will accept the
Secretary-General’s registration as a sufficient basis or whether it wants to form a prima
facie opinion on jurisdiction before recommending provisional measures.”>

In Holiday Inns v Morocco, the question of jurisdiction was still disputed when the
Tribunal gave its decision on provisional measures. The Tribunal said:

The Tribunal ... considers that it has jurisdiction to recommend provisional measures
according to the terms of Art. 47 ... the Parties still having the right to express, in the
rest of the procedure, any exception relating to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal on any
other aspect of the dispute.”°

In CSOB v Slovakia, jurisdiction was still being considered by the Tribunal when it
issued its first three decisions on provisional measures.’’ By the time of its fourth
decision on provisional measures on 1 March 2000, the Respondent had submitted a
Further and Partial Objection to Jurisdiction which was pending before the Tribunal.”®

In Pey Casado v Chile, the preliminary measures requested by both parties were
addressed by the Tribunal before the issue of jurisdiction. The Tribunal observed that

1072 SCHREUER’S COMMENTARY ON THE ICSID CONVENTION

international case law is clear in stating that the fact that jurisdiction may be disputed
does not deprive a tribunal of its power to decide upon provisional measures. The
Tribunal noted that, while Chile objected to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, it nevertheless
also introduced a request for provisional measures. The Tribunal interpreted this
conduct as recognition of the Tribunal’s powers under Art. 47 of the Convention and
of Arbitration Rule 39. The Tribunal said:

provisional measures, which are provisional by nature and by definition ... can be
modified or annulled at any time by the Tribunal, do not enjoy ‘res judicata’ effect, are
only valid for the duration of the procedure and ‘would automatically fall’ were the
arbitral tribunal to decide that it is incompetent to consider the dispute.”

68 Similarly, in SGS v Pakistan, the Tribunal dealt with SGS’ request for provisional
measures before it ruled on Pakistan’s jurisdictional objections. The Tribunal was
careful to state, in its decision on provisional measures, that it had considered SGS’
request without prejudice to Pakistan’s objection to the Tribunal’s competence and
jurisdiction to hear the claim.'°

69 In Azurix v Argentina, the Tribunal received Azurix’s request while the parties were
exchanging memorials on the objections to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. The Tribunal
relied on Art. 47 of the Convention and Arbitration Rule 39 to confirm that it was within
its power to recommend provisional measures while objections to jurisdiction were
pending, since neither provision specified any particular time in the procedure when
such measures can be recommended.'°’ The timing of the request was not a source of
contention between the parties, and the Respondent had simply noted that the Tribunal
should ‘avoid anticipating any judgment on matters still pending before the
Tribunal.’'°* The Tribunal stated that, while its finding that it had authority to recom-
mend provisional measures reflected its view that it had prima facie jurisdiction, this
was without prejudice to its determination on this matter which would be made
following the hearing on jurisdiction.’

70 Similarly, in Bayindir v Pakistan, the Tribunal emphasized that the reasons contained
in its decision on provisional measures were ‘without prejudice to a later decision of this
Tribunal on Pakistan’s objection to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.’’*

71 In Biwater Gauff v Tanzania, the Claimant formulated its request for provisional
measures in the Request for Arbitration and later reformulated them with a separate
submission.'°° In its reply to the reformulated request, Tanzania anticipated that it
intended to introduce objections to jurisdiction and other preliminary issues and asked
the Tribunal to take these factors into account and exercise caution in acting under
Art. 47 of the Convention.’ In its response, Biwater relied on the First Edition of this
Commentary to argue that, since a request for provisional measures may have to be

decided before a tribunal has ruled on its jurisdiction, a party may be exposed to
provisional measures, even if it contests the tribunal’s jurisdiction. '°” The Tribunal
also relied on this statement — which was not disputed between the parties — but added
that in some instances the existence of objections to jurisdiction may be ‘a relevant
factor in a tribunal’s exercise of its discretion to recommend provisional measures (for
example in a case where there is no urgency or questionable necessity).

Article 47 — Provisional Measures 1073

2108

In Occidental v Ecuador, the Tribunal said:

After noting that the Request for Arbitration invoked the Ecuador—United States BIT,
as well as a contract, as a basis for jurisdiction, the Tribunal concluded that prima facie
bases of jurisdiction existed in the case before it.

In Perenco v Ecuador, the Tribunal appeared to endorse a stringent or restrictive (or
“slower’) exercise of Art. 47 in circumstances where a tribunal has not yet decided on its

Whilst the Tribunal need not definitely satisfy itself that it has jurisdiction in respect of
the merits of the case at issue for purposes of ruling upon the requested provisional
measures, it will not order such measures unless there is, prima facie, a basis upon
which the Tribunal’s jurisdiction might be established.’

jurisdiction.''’ As the Tribunal explained, Art. 47 and Rule 39

Subsequent tribunals have not endorsed this stricter approach. In Caratube and
Hourani v Kazaskhstan, the Respondent argued, on the basis of Perenco v Ecuador,
that because the Tribunal had not yet decided on its jurisdiction, it should exercise its
Art. 47 power strictly. However, the Tribunal rejected the notion of a stricter stand-

recognize that a Tribunal must be slow to grant to a party, before a full examination of
the merits of the case, a remedy to which, on such examination, the party may be found
to be not entitled. The Tribunal must be even slower where, as here, the jurisdiction of
the tribunal to entertain the dispute has not been established. So the test laid down by
the Article for the grant of provisional measures is a stringent one.'!*

ard.''? As the Tribunal explained:

In the opinion of this Tribunal, there is no room for the application of a stricter standard
or, in the words of the Perenco Ecuador tribunal, of a ‘slower’ approach, simply
because a party has reserved its right to raise a jurisdictional objection. Rather, a
tribunal may take such a reservation of rights into account in the exercise of its
discretion to recommend provisional measures, namely when deciding whether or not
the urgency of the matter requires it to defer the provisional measures until after the
issue of the tribunal’s jurisdiction has been argued and decided. For instance, there
should be urgency to recommend some measures that could not await the final Award in
an arbitration while such urgency would not make it necessary to recommend such
measures before the arbitral tribunal’s determination on its jurisdiction. Be it as it
may ... this Tribunal finds that, given the alleged urgency of the Claimants’ Request

for Provisional Measures, it would defeat that Request’s purpose to first seek the
Parties’ respective positions on the issue of jurisdiction.''*

6. The Temporary Nature of Provisional Measures

The provisional nature of interim measures implies that they are recommended only
for the duration of the proceedings. Moreover, there is no res judicata effect which
means that the parties may at any time request their modification or termination.''° In
accordance with Arbitration Rule 39(3) the tribunal may at any time modify or revoke
them.''® If the circumstances requiring the provisional measures no longer exist, the
tribunal is under an obligation to revoke them.

Provisional measures will lapse automatically upon the rendering of the tribunal’s
award. They will also lapse upon the discontinuance of the proceedings in accordance
with Arbitration Rules 43-45, Although neither Art. 47 nor Arbitration Rule 39 say so
explicitly, this is a consequence of their provisional nature.

In MINE v Guinea, a request was made for the re-hearing and modification of the
provisional measures recommended on 4 December 1985. The ICSID Tribunal rejected
this request on 5 February 1986.''”

In SGS v Pakistan, the Tribunal stressed its power to reconsider provisional measures
at any time:

It is scarcely necessary to add that this like any procedural order on provisional
measures may be re-visited on the application of either party and after hearing the
other party, should circumstances change materially during the pendency of the juris-
dictional phase of this proceeding.''®

In City Oriente v Ecuador, the Tribunal, after holding a hearing, had ordered
provisional measures on 19 November 2007. The order for provisional measures stated
that they shall remain in force until modified or revoked by the Tribunal or until the
rendering of the final award. On 1 February 2008, the Respondent filed a Request for
Revocation of the Provisional Measures. After pleadings by both parties, the Tribunal
on 13 May 2008 decided to deny the request for revocation and ‘to ratify the Provisional
Measures previously ordered.’!'?

In Nova Group v Romania (see paras. 42-43 supra; paras. 187-190, 241 infra), the
Claimants sought provisional measures requiring Romania to, among other things,
suspend all criminal proceedings relating to the arbitration, refrain from initiating any
other proceedings against the officers of its investment companies, and withdraw an
arrest warrant and extradition request submitted to the United Kingdom in respect of

one such officer.'?° Ultimately, the requested provisional measures were denied, other
than the request for an order to withdraw the European arrest warrant and the extradition
request relating to one officer, until the arbitration was complete.'?) Romania filed an
application for the Tribunal to reconsider the terms of its Procedural Order No 7, on the
basis that compliance with its terms was difficult for various reasons, including that it
would require interference with the independent Romanian judiciary, and be perceived
by the public as unacceptable preferential treatment.'** The Tribunal found that because
provisional measures are ‘provisional,’ parties can apply to modify or terminate prior
recommendations based on changed circumstances, but not on the exact same eviden-
tiary and legal record as previously presented.'*? Because Romania did not allege any
change of circumstances, and instead was simply arguing that Tribunal’s initial assess-
ment was wrong, there was no basis for reconsideration. '7*

In Menzies v Senegal, the Tribunal granted provisional measures in its Procedural
Order No. 2, in which it determined that it had prima facie jurisdiction over the
Claimant’s claim.'* It recommended that the Respondent refrain from measures which
would aggravate or prolong the dispute, or compromise the smooth running of the
arbitration. !*° Ultimately, however, the Tribunal found that it lacked jurisdiction over
the Claimant’s claim.'*’

D. ‘... if it considers that the circumstances so require, ... which should be taken
to preserve the respective rights ...’

1, Necessity

The preparatory works to the Convention give little indication of the circumstances
which would require provisional measures, although more clarity on this point was at
times demanded (History, Vol. I, pp. 337 ff., 515, 573). It was pointed out that such
measures would only be used in situations of absolute necessity (ibid., pp. 270, 523) and
that tribunals would exercise self-restraint in their application (ibid., p. 516).

ICSID arbitration practice shows that tribunals will only grant provisional measures,
if they are found to be necessary in the sense that they are required in order to preserve a
party’s rights from irreparable harm.'?* The requirements of necessity and urgency (see
paras. 83-100 infra) are usually considered together. For instance, the Tribunal in
Border Timbers v Zimbabwe expressed the requirement as being that provisional
measures must only be granted where ‘necessary to preserve a party’s rights and urgent
in order to avoid irreparable harm.’!??

The requesting party has the burden of showing why the measures should be
recommended. As noted by the Tribunal in Maffezini v Spain:

1076 SCHREUER’S COMMENTARY ON THE ICSID CONVENTION

The imposition of provisional measures is an extraordinary measure which should not
be granted lightly by the Arbitral Tribunal. There is no doubt that the applicant, in this
case the Respondent, has the burden to demonstrate why the Tribunal should grant its
application.'°°

The Tribunal in Plama v Bulgaria also stressed that the need for provisional measures
must be urgent and necessary to preserve the status quo or to avoid irreparable
damage.'*! In the particular case, the Tribunal found both the urgency and the irrepar-
able nature of the harm invoked by Plama to be lacking. The Tribunal’s ability to decide
on the Claimant’s right to monetary damages would not be affected by the outcome of
the proceedings in Bulgaria addressed in the Claimant’s request for provisional
measures. '°”

The Tribunal in Saipem v Bangladesh confirmed that Art. 47 requires ‘that the
requested measure be both necessary and urgent.’ It found that pending litigation for
the encashment of a warranty bond meant that these conditions were met. On the other
hand, there was no necessity and urgency with respect to the return of a retention
money.’*°

The Tribunal in Occidental v Ecuador also recalled the well-established rule that
provisional measures should only be granted in situations of necessity to avoid irrepar-
able harm,'** and relied mainly on the case law of the ICJ and cited the Aegean Sea
Continental Shelf case for the premise that a provisional measure is necessary where the
actions of a party ‘are capable of causing or of threatening irreparable prejudice to the
rights invoked.’!*°

Multiple tribunals have agreed that the requisite standard is that provisional measures
must be necessary in order to avoid ‘irreparable’ harm.'*° That may be either in the
sense that the harm is not ‘adequately reparable by an award of damages,’ or that there is
a ‘material risk of serious or grave damage to the requesting party.’ Thus, in Quiborax v
Bolivia, the Tribunal held that:

The Tribunal considers that an irreparable harm is a harm that cannot be repaired by an
award of damages. Such a standard has been adopted by several ICSID tribunals and
embodied in Art. 17A of the UNCITRAL Model Law. That provision requires the party
requesting an interim measure to satisfy the tribunal that:

‘Harm not adequately repaired by an award of damages is likely to result if the

result to the party against whom the measure is directed if the measure is granted.’!*’

Some tribunals have found that what is required is a risk of ‘irreparable or substantial

harm,

"138 Which arguably amounts to a lowering of the standard of harm required.

A few tribunals have even held that ‘irreparable’ harm is not necessary. For instance, the
Tribunal in City Oriente v Ecuador observed that

neither Article 47 of the Convention nor Rule 39 of the Arbitration Rules require that
provisional measures be ordered only as a means to prevent irreparable harm. The only
requirement arising from the wording of Rule 39 is the traditional urgency
requirement.'*?

In PNG Sustainable Development v Papua New Guinea, the Tribunal held that:

In the Tribunal’s view, the term ‘irreparable’ harm is properly understood as requiring a
showing of a material risk of serious or grave damage to the requesting party, and not
harm that is literally ‘irreparable’ in what is sometimes regarded as the narrow common
law sense of the term. The degree of ‘gravity’ or ‘seriousness’ of harm that is necessary
for an order of provisional relief cannot be specified with precision, and depends in part
on the circumstances of the case, the nature of the relief requested and the relative harm
to be suffered by each party; suffice it to say that substantial, serious harm, even if not
irreparable, is generally sufficient to satisfy this element of the standard for granting
provisional measures.'*°

The Tribunal held that the harm must not be purely hypothetical or theoretical,
holding that:

The Tribunal is also of the view that the requesting party need not prove that ‘serious’
harm is certain to occur. Rather, it is generally sufficient to show that there is a material
risk that it will occur. The requirement of showing material risk does not, however,
imply a showing of any particular percentage of likelihood, or probability, that the risk
will materialize. The proper requirement is that the requesting party must establish the
existence of a sufficient risk or threat that grave or serious harm will occur if provisional
measures are not granted.'*"

1078 SCHREUER’S COMMENTARY ON THE ICSID CONVENTION

Some tribunals have considered whether the future harm must be probable or merely
possible. The Occidental tribunal held that the mere possibility of future harm was not
sufficient:

Provisional measures are not meant to protect against any potential or hypothetical harm
susceptible to result from uncertain actions. Rather they are meant to protect the
requesting party from imminent harm.'**

The Tribunal was convinced that in the case before it there was no risk of irreparable
or imminent harm which could justify the request for provisional measures sought by
the Claimants. '**

2. Urgency

During the drafting of the Convention, an attempt to have a reference to ‘urgency’
and ‘imminent danger’ included was defeated (History, Vol. II, p. 815), but it is clear
that provisional measures will only be appropriate if it is urgent in the sense that the
question cannot await the outcome of the award on the merits.'**

The Tribunal in Azurix v Argentina noted that Art. 47 of the Convention does not
specify the degree of urgency required to grant provisional measures. It related the
probability of prejudice to the requirement of urgency as follows:

Given that the purpose of the measures is to preserve the rights of the parties, the
urgency is related to the imminent possibility that the rights of a party be prejudiced
before the tribunal has rendered its award.'*°

In Biwater Gauff v Tanzania, the Claimant justified the urgency of its request by
stating that, in accordance with ICSID jurisprudence,

necessity and urgency are present where a Respondent fails to take steps to preserve or
to provide documentation relevant to a Claimant’s case, or in circumstances where there
is a risk of loss or destruction of such documentation.!*°

The Tribunal expressed the view that the degree of urgency required for a recom-
mendation of provisional measures depended on the circumstances of the case and may
be satisfied when a party can prove that there is a need to obtain the measure requested
before the issuance of an award. The Tribunal added that it also believed that the level
of urgency required depends on the type of measure requested.'*’ In the particular case,
the Tribunal concluded that the requirements of necessity and urgency were met, for the
following reasons:

.. . the former because of the potential need for the evidence in question, and the latter
because there is a need for such evidence to be preserved before the proceedings progress
any further (e.g. to enable each party properly to plead their respective cases).'*®

The Tribunal in Occidental v Ecuador also applied the rule that provisional measures 99
should only be granted in situations of urgency.'“? In this connection, the Tribunal
mentioned a judgment of the ICJ, the Passage through the Great Belt case,'°° for the
proposition that “a measure is urgent where action prejudicial to the rights of either party
is likely to be taken before such final decision is given.’'”’

It is apparent that the two requirements of necessity and urgency are often addressed 100
together, as one commentator has noted: “Although these elements are formally separate
in the provisional measures calculus, the latter is so dependent on the former that they
are almost always addressed together.’ '>*

3. Other Circumstances

In addition to the requirements of necessity and urgency, some tribunals have found 101
that it is relevant to consider whether the granting of provisional measures would be
‘proportionate.’ '>° Thus, in Hydro and others v Albania, the Tribunal accepted the
parties’ formulation that provisional measures must be (i) necessary to protect the
applicant’s rights, (ii) urgent, and (iii) proportionate.'°* With respect to proportionality,
this meant that the Tribunal ‘must balance the harm caused to the Claimants by the
criminal proceedings and the harm that would be caused to the Respondent if those
proceedings were stayed.’!°°

Commentators have also identified other circumstances that may play arole, suchas 102
whether the provisional measures sought would be ‘capable of being carried out,’ as
well as the nature of the investment and its effect on whether any harm suffered could be
compensated. '*°

4. Recommended Measures

The Convention and the Arbitration Rules are silent on the types of provisional 103
measures that may be taken. In the course of the drafting of the Convention, the
question was raised whether it would be advisable to clarify what kind of provisional
measures lay within the powers of the tribunal (History, Vol. II, p. 337). One suggestion
was to require parties having recourse to ICSID arbitration to post a bond (ibid., p. 347).

A Turkish proposal provided for the party seeking provisional measures to give a
pecuniary guarantee in case the measures might harm the other party (ibid., pp. 664,
813). The Chairman pointed out that ‘in international practice authority to prescribe

1080 SCHREUER’S COMMENTARY ON THE ICSID CONVENTION

provisional measures was left to the appreciation of the tribunal, presumably because it
was difficult to foresee the types of situations that might arise’ (ibid., p. 515). In a show
of hands on the kind of provisional measures which could be recommended, the Legal
Committee eventually accepted the broad and open-ended formulation of Art. 47, which
closely follows that of Art. 41 of the ICJ Statute (ibid., p. 815).

The Convention and the Arbitration Rules do not specify which rights might deserve
protection by way of provisional measures. The Working Paper, the earliest draft to the
Convention, as well as the immediately subsequent Preliminary Draft, referred to ‘any
provisional measures necessary for the protection of the rights of the parties’ (History,
Vol. I, p. 206). The Comment to the Preliminary Draft explained that the provisional
measures were designed to preserve the status quo between the parties pending the
tribunal’s final decision on the merits (History, Vol. II, p. 216). At one point, the
question was raised whether the status quo existing during the normal execution of
the contract, or at the time when the controversy arose, would be decisive. The
Chairman thought that the purpose of the provisional measures must be, as far as
possible, to preserve the status quo at the time when the provisional measures were
requested (ibid., p. 337). One expert suggested that the purpose of provisional measures
must be to ensure that a party did not take action that would frustrate a possible award
(ibid., p. 337). Other proposals referred to an obligation of the parties to refrain from
taking any steps that would aggravate or extend the dispute and a provisional protection
of the rights of the parties on the merits (ibid., p. 338).

At the next stage of the drafting process, the First Draft provided for provisional
measures ‘necessary to prevent or halt any action by either party which might frustrate
an eventual award’ (History, Vol. I, p. 206). This wording was criticized as being too
restrictive since it would mean that, before provisional measures could be ordered, the
tribunal had to be satisfied that the whole purport of the award would be completely
frustrated, unless the provisional measures were ordered. It was also pointed out that it
was not logical to prescribe provisional measures that would depend on a future and
uncertain fact, such as the eventual award (History, Vol. II, p. 813). Other experts were
against a provision that did not specify the right to be preserved or advocated for
retaining a reference to the possible frustration of the award (ibid., pp. 814, 891).
Nevertheless, the reference to a possible frustration of the eventual award was dropped
in the Revised Draft (ibid., p. 925), and the Convention was adopted without any
reference to the nature of the respective rights that were to be protected.

Arbitration Rule 39(1) requires a party requesting provisional measures to, inter alia,
specify the right to be preserved. The cases before ICSID tribunals show that the parties,
in requesting provisional measures, have invoked a number of different rights discussed
during the Convention’s drafting, such as the non-aggravation of the dispute, the non-
frustration of the eventual award, and the ‘rights in dispute.’ However, the most
frequently invoked rights were not addressed during the Convention’s drafting process,
namely procedural rights of the parties in the arbitration, such as the preservation and
production of evidence, the exclusive nature of ICSID arbitration, and the confidential-
ity of proceedings.

It is evident that the nature of the measures to be recommended will very much
depend on the particular circumstances of the case and on the rights that are to be
protected. Therefore, no exhaustive list of provisional measures which may be used by

JIHSISSEsA OSS Published online by Cambridge University Press

Article 47 — Provisional Measures 1081

tribunals can be given. Under Arbitration Rule 39(1), a party requesting provisional
measures must, inter alia, specify the measures the recommendation of which is
requested. A look at the cases in which ICSID tribunals have dealt with such requests
shows that a variety of measures have been sought.'>’ They include discovery requests
to secure vital evidence, requests for prejudgment security, requests for injunctions
directed at the parties to abstain from seeking relief in domestic courts, and requests for
recommendations that the other party refrain from resorting to the press. Sometimes,
tribunals admit the availability of certain types of provisional measures in principle,
while denying that they are required by the specific circumstances of the case.

The degree of specificity of provisional measures varies greatly. Some are very 108
concrete and indicate exactly what steps are to be taken by the parties. Others remain
at a high level of abstraction and merely contain general guidelines as to the parties’
behavior. The Azurix tribunal observed in this respect:

ICSID arbitral tribunals have recommended specific provisional measures but they have
also specified the objective to guide the measures to be taken and have left it to the party
or parties concerned ‘to consider the various possible hypotheses’ that will achieve the
recommended objective.'?®

The Tribunal in Biwater Gauff v Tanzania cited the First Edition of this Commentary 109
for its assertion that the power of tribunals to grant provisional measures is very broad
and is not limited to substantive rights, but also includes procedural rights.’ Other
tribunals have agreed, and have issued provisional measures that protect procedural
rights, such as provisional measures containing an order for security for costs.'©°

Relatedly, a frequently stated objective of provisional measures is the non- 110
aggravation of the dispute. Thus, in Burlington v Ecuador, the Tribunal held that

the rights to be preserved by provisional measures are not limited to those which form
the subject-matter of the dispute or substantive rights as referred to by the Respondents,
but may extend to procedural rights, including the general right to the status quo and to
the non-aggravation of the dispute. These latter rights are thus self-standing rights.'°!

There are several typical situations in which parties request provisional measures: 111

e It may be necessary to require the parties to cooperate in the proceedings and
to furnish all relevant evidence.

e It may be necessary to take early measures to secure compliance with an eventual
award (such as by obtaining a financial guarantee), or it may be necessary to obtain
security for one of the parties’ costs.

a) Orders for the Preservation or Obtaining of Evidence

112 Access to evidence is secured by Art. 43 of the Convention, which provides that the
tribunal may ‘call upon the parties to produce documents or other evidence.’
Nevertheless, parties have at times requested provisional measures under Art. 47 to
secure or obtain evidence. In some cases, tribunals have acceded to these requests.

113 In AGIP v Congo, the Claimant’s subsidiary in the Congo had been nationalized. In
the course of the nationalization, the Government had occupied the local offices and
seized the company’s records. AGIP lodged a request for ‘measures of preservation’ in
accordance with Art. 47 to the effect that the Government should be directed to collect
all the documents that had been kept at the local office, furnish the Tribunal with a
complete list of these documents, and keep these documents available for presentation
to the Tribunal at AGIP’s request. The Tribunal made a decision, as requested, '© but
the Government did not comply with the recommendation (see also para. 47 supra).

114 In Vacuum Salt v Ghana, the Claimant submitted a Request for Provisional Measures
expressing concern, inter alia, over the preservation of its corporate records. The
Tribunal’s first Decision on Provisional Measures of 3 December 1992 took note of a
voluntary undertaking by the Government that it would not deny the Claimant access to
its records.'°?

115 In Azurix v Argentina, the Respondent asked the Tribunal to request Azurix to submit
the original of a decision of the Argentine Appeals Chamber, which it could not obtain
due to the period of judicial holidays in Argentina. The Tribunal did not consider it
necessary to accept this request because it depended on a temporary situation (the
judicial holidays) and because it was a decision of the Respondent’s own tribunals.'™

116 In Sempra v Argentina, the Claimant filed a request for provisional measures to
secure the oral testimony of two of its witnesses. The Tribunal, in a decision on
provisional measures, noted that an Argentinian federal court had issued an injunction
to prevent one of the witnesses from testifying in the ICSID proceedings. The Tribunal
referred to Arts. 21 and 22 of the ICSID Convention dealing with the immunity of
witnesses, to Art. 26 dealing with the exclusivity of ICSID proceedings, and to
Arbitration Rule 34(3) dealing with the parties’ duty to cooperate in the production of
evidence. The Tribunal’s order was that Argentina shall adopt the necessary measures to

Article 47 — Provisional Measures 1083

comply with these provisions and in particular shall refrain from any conduct that may
impair the witness’s ability to provide oral testimony.'®

In Biwater Gauff v Tanzania, the Claimant requested, inter alia, that the Tribunal 117
recommend provisional measures to preserve Biwater’s rights in respect of certain
records, papers, documents, and mail of City Water, the company which the Claimant
had set up in Tanzania in order to carry out its investment.'©° Biwater subsequently
reformulated its request for provisional measures to include the preservation and
provision of documentation in respect of City Water’s bank accounts, and a statement
of account relating to City Water’s assets. Biwater further requested that the Respondent
procure an inventory of all of City Water’s papers, records, and correspondence seized
at the time of the occupation of City Water’s offices.'©’ Biwater argued that it had been
denied access to documentary evidence that was central to its claims for damages and
that this would hamper the presentation of its claims in an effective manner and affect
the Tribunal’s ability to decide the claims fairly.'°*

Tanzania, for its part, argued that Biwater had failed to show a threat to its right to the 118
preservation and production of evidence. Tanzania added that parties to ICSID proceed-
ings, at most, have a right to ask for production of documents under Art. 43 of the
Convention, a right which — in Tanzania’s view — should not be bypassed by asking for
document production in the guise of a request for provisional measures under Art. 47 of
the Convention.’

The Biwater tribunal found that the Claimant’s request to preserve evidence was 119
reasonable, as the requirements of necessity and urgency had been met. There was a
potential need for the evidence and it needed to be preserved before the proceedings
progressed any further, in order to enable the parties to properly plead their respective
cases.'’° The Tribunal noted Tanzania’s undertaking to voluntarily preserve all the
evidence involved.'’' The Tribunal recommended under Art. 47 that Tanzania preserve
the relevant documents.’’? The Tribunal also invited the parties ‘to cooperate in
establishing a workable and non-burdensome inventory.’*”°

With regard to the production of documents, the Biwater tribunal observed that 120
normally such a request is made within the ambit of Art. 43 of the Convention and
Arbitration Rule 34. Arts. 47 and 43 serve different purposes:

Indeed, the two procedures are aimed at two different issues: Art. 47 is designed to
ensure that the arbitral tribunal can properly discharge its mandate, whilst Art. 43 is one
element in a range of provisions that structures how the mandate is to be discharged.'’*

The Tribunal did not exclude the possibility, albeit exceptional, that document 121
production could be ordered under Art. 47. However, the Tribunal found that this was

not warranted in the circumstances of the case, primarily because no right was
threatened.’

122 In Quiborax v Bolivia, the Tribunal agreed with the Tribunals in Biwater Gauff v
Tanzania and AGIP v Congo that it had ‘the power to grant provisional measures to
preserve the procedural integrity of the ICSID proceedings, in particular the access to
and integrity of the evidence.’'’° In Quiborax, the Claimant was concerned at preserv-
ing documentary evidence as well as its access to potential witnesses who were
involved in criminal proceedings. As the Tribunal recorded,

the criminal proceedings may indeed be impairing Claimants’ right to present their case,
in particular with respect to their access to documentary evidence and witnesses.
Claimants have been deprived of their corporate records and, although it appears from
the record that Claimants have had access to copies of certain documents, it is unclear
whether they are still missing relevant documentation that might assist them in present-
ing their case on jurisdiction or the merits.'””

123 The Tribunal concluded that:

Claimants have shown the existence of a threat to the procedural integrity of the ICSID
proceedings, in particular with respect to their right to access to evidence through
potential witnesses. In the words of the Plama tribunal, the Tribunal finds that, under
the particular circumstances of this case, the rights invoked by Claimants and analyzed
in this Section relate to Claimants’ ‘ability to have [their] claims and requests for relief
in the arbitration fairly considered and decided by the arbitral tribunal.’'”*

b) Orders for Financial Security

124 In some cases, parties have demanded that their opponent provide some form of
financial security. Claimants have demanded that respondents post a security for the
award’s performance, that is, to ensure compliance with their (future) obligation to pay
compensation in accordance with the award. In turn, respondents have demanded that
claimants provide a security for the legal costs which the respondents incur in defending
the claimant’s claim. It is relevant to note that the rights of the prevailing party are
protected by the Convention’s provisions on the recognition and enforcement of
awards, and it is difficult to see how a respondent whose willingness or ability to abide
by a final award is in doubt could be persuaded to pay on the basis of a recommendation
for provisional measures. However, a claimant whose claim may be doubtful, and
whose willingness or ability to cover the resulting costs is not clear, may be required
to provide a financial guarantee (or ‘security for costs’) as a condition for the tribunal
proceeding with the principal claim.

Article 47 — Provisional Measures 1085
In Atlantic Triton v Guinea,'’ the Claimant requested that the Respondent be 125
directed to post a guarantee in an amount equal to that pursued on the principal claim.

The Claimant argued that the Respondent might be unable or unwilling to honor an
eventual award. Guinea, in turn, demanded a guarantee to cover its expenses arising

from attachments which had been obtained by Atlantic Triton (see also Art. 26, paras.
276-279). The Government argued that the foreign investor was in the process of
liquidating its assets and would soon be insolvent and unable to pay Guinea its costs.

The Tribunal, in an unpublished opinion of 18 December 1984, rejected both parties’ 126
requests. While finding that recommendations of this kind were within its mandate
under Art. 47, it found that neither party had established that the circumstances of the
case required the requested relief. As summarized by Friedland:

The Tribunal was unconvinced that Atlantic Triton was in the process of liquidation,
and was unmoved by the foreign investor’s allegations of the Republic’s insolvency,
stating that ‘there is no reason to suppose that the Government of Guinea could not
perform any obligations for which the final award might hold it responsible.’ '*°

The Tribunal also expressed some fundamental reservations about prejudgment 127
security. They are summarized by Friedland in the following terms:

The Tribunal was further dissuaded from granting the requested pre-judgment security
by the fact that both requests were directly linked to, and dependent on, resolution of the
basic claims in the arbitration. This was particularly so with respect to Atlantic Triton’s
request which virtually restated its principal claim.

The Atlantic Triton decision thus establishes that pre-judgment security to ensure
payment of an eventual award will not be granted in the ordinary course of ICSID
arbitrations.'*!

In Maffezini v Spain, the Respondent requested the Tribunal to require the Claimant to 128
post a bond, or some form of guarantee for the costs that were likely to be sustained in the
arbitration.'®* In denying Spain’s request for provisional measures, the Tribunal noted
that the request hinged on two hypotheticals: whether the Claimant would succeed in its
claim and whether the Respondent would be required to pay the costs of the arbitration.
Consequently, it held that ‘[e]xpectations of success or failure in an arbitration or judicial
case are conjectures,’ and concluded that ‘[i]t would be improper for the Tribunal to
prejudge the Claimant’s case by recommending provisional measures of this nature.’'**

The Tribunal further ruled that the relief requested was unrelated to the subject-matter of
the arbitration and should therefore be rejected for that additional reason.'**

In Pey Casado v Chile, Chile asked the Tribunal to order the production of guarantees 129
sufficient to cover the costs that would be incurred by the losing party in the arbitra-
tion.'*° The Claimants opposed the request, arguing that it was unfounded as it
concemed non-existing or potential rights, and prejudged the decision of the Tribunal.

The Tribunal noted that neither Art. 47 nor Arbitration Rule 39 foresaw the granting

1086 SCHREUER’S COMMENTARY ON THE ICSID CONVENTION

of a conservatory measure aiming at the payment of a cautio judicatum solvi, or a
‘pre-judgment security.’ '®° Nevertheless, the Tribunal observed that, in some particular
cases, a tribunal could recommend the deposit of a guarantee to protect a respondent
against the non-payment by a claimant of costs in case of insolvency. The recommen-
dation of such a measure fell within an ICSID tribunal’s mandate under Art. 47 of the
Convention, as held by the Tribunal in Atlantic Triton v Guinea.'®"

130 The Tribunal stated that in the circumstances of the case the recommendation of the
measure requested was not justified since

it has not been shown nor even suggested as particularly probable or evident that this
risk is present in this case, or, even assuming that this risk is established, that it makes
the recommendation of the conservative measure requested necessary.'**

131 In Bayindir v Pakistan, the Tribunal rejected Pakistan’s request to recommend that
Bayindir provide security for Pakistan’s costs in the arbitration.'*?
132 In Libananco v Turkey, the Tribunal rejected Turkey’s application for security

for costs. Its application was based on its claim that the Claimant was ‘a shell
company without assets of its own,’ and that it was therefore ‘unlikely to be able
to meet an eventual award of costs against it should either its jurisdictional or its
merits claims be rejected by the Tribunal in due course.’'?° The Libananco tribunal
gave Turkey’s application short shrift, finding that ‘[t]he state of Libananco’s assets
is not at this stage the subject of proof, but of mere assertion and counter-assertion,’
and it added that it was not ‘standard practice for ICSID Tribunals invariably to
make an award of costs against a losing Party.’'?' The Tribunal further held that
there was

no express reference to such an award in the Convention itself, and Rule 47(1)q) of the
Arbitration Rules is cast in broad and flexible terms which in its application entails an
exercise of discretion by the individual tribunal in the light of the particular circum-
stances of the dispute before it.'”*

133 The Tribunal added that ‘it would only be in the most extreme case — one in which an
essential interest of either Party stood in danger of irreparable damage — that the
possibility of granting security for costs should be entertained at all.’!°°

134 In RSM v Grenada IT, the Tribunal observed that it was

difficult to formulate a rule of general application against which to measure whether the
making of an order for security for costs might be reasonable, but it seems clear to us
that more should be required than a simple showing of the likely inability of a claimant
to pay a possible costs award.'™*

Article 47 — Provisional Measures 1087

The Tribunal noted that Grenada had ‘made no showing of Claimants’ impecuniosity, 135
nor of any unwillingness on their part to pay a costs award.’!”° The Tribunal therefore
rejected the Respondent’s application for security for costs.

The first ICSID tribunal to have ordered the payment of security for costs is the 136
Tribunal in RSM v St Lucia. In that case, the Respondent argued that the Tribunal had
the power to order security for costs on the basis of its power to recommend provisional
measures. The Respondent acknowledged that no tribunal had yet made such an order,
but argued that such an order was justified in the present case owing to a ‘material risk
that Claimant will be unable or unwilling to comply with a costs award issued against
it.”'°° The Respondent argued that this ‘material risk’ existed on the basis of:

e ‘prior arbitrations under the auspices of ICSID, in which Claimant failed to honor its
obligations under costs awards or requests for payment of advances’; in particular,
the Respondent referred to an ICSID proceeding where the Claimant ‘did not honor
the costs award issued against it and to an ICSID annulment proceeding which was
discontinued due to Claimant’s failure to pay the advances on costs’;'?’

e ‘the conduct of Claimant’s CEO in prior court proceedings, not limited to ICSID
arbitrations, as an expression of Claimant’s alleged unreliability concerning the
compliance with orders of courts and tribunals’ ;!78

e the Claimant’s initiation of ‘a number of arbitrations and litigation proceedings
subsequent to the aforementioned costs awards which it did not comply with,’
which led the Respondent to conclude that ‘despite Claimant’s financial situation it
goes on to engage in litigation and arbitration and is thus likely not to honor a
future costs award’;!?? and

e the fact that the proceedings initiated by the Claimant were ‘funded by third
parties’ (which the Claimant had admitted), leading the Respondent to the conclu-
sion that ‘these third parties fund the initiation of proceedings, but they will not
comply with Claimant’s obligations under a resulting costs award’; this constituted
‘an exceptional situation justifying an order of security for costs,’ which was
described by the Respondent as ‘arbitral hit-and-run.’?°?

In light of these facts, the Tribunal considered there to be a ‘material and serious risk 137
that a costs award would not be complied with,’ and the existence of third-party funding

further support[ed] the Tribunal’s concern that Claimant will not comply with a costs
award rendered against it, since, in the absence of security or guarantees being offered, it is
doubtful whether the third party will assume responsibility for honoring such an award.7"!

Bearing these considerations in mind, the Tribunal concluded that it was ‘necessary 138
to order Claimant to provide security for costs before proceeding further with this
arbitration.’”°” The Tribunal explained why this case was different from previous cases
in which such applications had been considered and rejected:

1088 SCHREUER’S COMMENTARY ON THE ICSID CONVENTION

86. The difference between the present proceeding and previous ICSID arbitrations in
which the request for security for costs was in every case denied, is that in this case the
circumstances which were brought forward in other proceedings occur cumulatively.
Those circumstances are, in summary, the proven history where Claimant did not comply
with cost orders and awards due to its inability or unwillingness, the fact that it admittedly
does not have sufficient financial resources itself and the (also admitted) fact that it is
funded by an unknown third party which, as the Tribunal sees reasons to believe, might
not warrant compliance with a possible costs award rendered in favour of Respondent.

87. Against the background of the aforesaid, the Tribunal, after carefully balancing
Respondent’s interest with Claimant’s right to access to justice, is confident that the
described circumstances constitute sufficient grounds and exceptional circumstances as
required by ICSID jurisprudence for ordering Claimant to provide security for costs.””°

139 Following the Tribunal’s decision in RSM v St Lucia, other ICSID tribunals have
confirmed their power to order security for costs,” although tribunals routinely stress
that it is an exceptional form of provisional measure, and in most cases, such applications
are denied.*°° Indeed, in EuroGas and Belmont v Slovakia, the Tribunal affirmed the
view that security for costs should only be granted in ‘exceptional circumstances.’”°° It
found that mere financial difficulties and third-party funding did not necessarily consti-
tute exceptional circumstances justifying an order of security for costs.7°”

140 However, in Herzig v Turkmenistan, Turkmenistan successfully obtained an order
granting security for costs against an insolvent Claimant being funded by a third-party
funder. The case turned on the fact that the third-party funding agreement did not cover
any award of costs against the Claimant in favor of Turkmenistan.*°* While the Tribunal
by majority affirmed the view that orders for security for costs are ‘extremely rare’ and
must meet the ‘high standard of exceptional circumstances,’ it held that the explicit non-
liability for an adverse costs award in the funding agreement presented an ‘extreme
situation.’?°

141 The Herzig tribunal noted by majority that in EuroGas and Belmont v Slovakia, it
was held that ‘financial difficulties and third party-funding ... do not necessarily
constitute per se exceptional circumstances justifying that the Respondent be granted
an order of security for costs.’?’° In Herzig, it was observed by the majority that
‘without security, it will be effectively impossible for Turkmenistan to enforce and
collect upon an adverse costs award.’7!! This, therefore, was beyond an ordinary risk

that every party in arbitration faces of not being able to collect on a costs award, and
was in fact a certainty, leading to an undue prejudice for Turkmenistan.7!”

Exceptionally, the Claimant also sought security for its claim should the 142
Respondent’s Request for Security for Costs be granted. The Claimant asserted that if
he ultimately not be assessed for costs in the arbitration, he must be granted, inter alia,
reimbursement of his costs for posting the security for costs and an order for security for
enforcement of any final award in his favor.*'* This was argued on the basis of equality
of treatment, which the Tribunal held to be ‘unprecedented ... for good reason’ and
dismissed the request.*!*

The Herzig tribunal noted that the proposed revision of the ICSID Arbitration Rules 143
requires tribunals to ‘consider all relevant circumstances,’ including ‘the effect that
providing security for costs may have on that party’s ability to pursue its claim’ and ‘the
conduct of the parties.’ According to the Tribunal, this Proposed Rule reinforces the
existing authority of ICSID tribunals to order security for costs, and articulates the high
standard tribunals currently apply in determining whether to order security for costs as
provisional measures.*'>

It follows from these authorities that, although ICSID tribunals have the power to 144
order the payment of security for costs, they will only do so in the most exceptional
circumstances.

c) Orders Restraining Parallel Domestic Proceedings

The largest group of cases in which tribunals have dealt with requests for provisional 145
measures concerned proceedings before domestic courts.7'° As such, they affected the
exclusive nature of ICSID arbitration and are therefore also discussed in that context
(see Art. 26, paras. 267-286). The exclusive nature of ICSID proceedings is secured by
Art. 26 of the Convention. ICSID tribunals have been asked repeatedly to enjoin parties
from seeking relief in domestic courts.

Various early ICSID decisions provide authority for the proposition that provisional 146
measures can be ordered under Art. 47 to restrain parallel domestic proceedings.*” In
one such example, MINE v Guinea, the Claimant had obtained an award against the
Respondent before the American Arbitration Association (AAA) in 1980 (see Art. 26,
paras. 9-19). The award was not paid, and in May 1985 MINE started attachment
proceedings in Belgian and Swiss courts for the purpose of enforcing the AAA award.

In September 1984, MINE had instituted ICSID arbitration and the Tribunal was
constituted on 17 June 1985. Guinea presented the Tribunal with an “Emergency
Request for Relief from Attachment of its Assets by MINE,’ asking that MINE be
directed to dissolve all pending attachments of Guinea’s bank accounts. Guinea relied

1090 SCHREUER’S COMMENTARY ON THE ICSID CONVENTION

on Art. 26 of the Convention, providing for remedies exclusively through ICSID
arbitration (see Art. 26, paras. 15-19, 274). On 3 July 1985, the Tribunal denied
Guinea’s request as premature since Guinea had not yet offered any defense in the
attachment proceedings. Guinea appealed against the Belgian and Swiss attachment
orders and submitted a request for reconsideration of the Emergency Request.

In its Decision on Provisional Measures of 4 December 1985,718 the Tribunal
directed MINE to immediately discontinue all its actions and attachments in domestic
courts:

The Tribunal recommends that MINE immediately withdraw and permanently discon-
tinue all pending litigation in national courts, and commence no new action, arising out
of the dispute. Litigation based upon the award of the American Arbitration Association
is considered to arise out of this dispute for purposes of this Provisional Measure.

The Tribunal further recommends that MINE dissolve every existing provisional
measure in litigation in national courts (including attachment, garnishment, sequestra-
tion, or seizure of the property of Guinea, by whatever term designated and by whatever
means performed) and seek no new provisional remedy in a national court.”!”

It is noteworthy that the Tribunal not only directed MINE to withdraw the existing
actions in domestic courts, but also enjoined the Claimant from starting any new
proceedings in the future.

MINE thereupon withdrew its appeal in Belgium, but a dispute ensued between the
parties concerning the security arrangements that MINE had provided to the Swiss
courts.-”° In a decision of 5 February 1986,77! the ICSID tribunal rejected MINE’s
request for revision and modification of the provisional measures. After the Tribunal
had clarified its Decision on Provisional Measures on 22 September 1986, recommend-
ing that all attachments be lifted and that all security arrangements be vacated, MINE
had the attachment released.?7"

MINE v Guinea gives unequivocal support to the protection of ICSID’s exclusivity
vis-a-vis domestic proceedings by way of provisional measures. This is clear not only
from the unambiguous language in which the Tribunal directs MINE to withdraw and
permanently discontinue the domestic proceedings, but also from the threat of sanctions
and the eventual award of damages for failure to comply with the Tribunal’s recom-
mendation in a timely fashion (see Art. 26, para. 274).

In CSOB v Slovakia, a ‘Consolidation Agreement’ between the parties provided for
the assignment of non-performing receivables by CSOB to a Collection Company
created for this purpose. The Collection Company was to pay CSOB for the assigned
receivables in accordance with a loan arrangement. The loan was secured by a guarantee
of the Slovak Ministry of Finance (see Art. 25, paras. 138-139). When the Collection

Company defaulted, CSOB instituted ICSID proceedings against Slovakia on the
basis of the guarantee. Bankruptcy proceedings against the Collection Company in
the Slovak domestic courts were pending simultaneously. These bankruptcy proceed-
ings were likely to lead to the determination of issues that were also before the
ICSID tribunal.

CSOB made several requests for provisional measures, seeking the suspension of the 152
bankruptcy proceedings pending against the Collection Company. The Tribunal at first
declined this request in two procedural orders.”*° The Tribunal found that it had no
reason to assume that the competent domestic court would fail to suspend the bank-
ruptcy proceedings to the extent that these would include a determination of issues
before the Tribunal. At the same time, the Tribunal found that the rights to be preserved
included, in principle, the right to the exclusive remedy provided for in Art. 26 and
deferred any further consideration of the Claimants’ request for provisional
measures.7~*

In a subsequent order, the Tribunal granted the request and recommended the 153
suspension of the bankruptcy proceedings

to the extent that such proceedings might include determinations as to whether the ...
[Slovak Collection Company] has a valid claim in the form of a right to receive funds
from the Slovak Republic to cover its losses as contemplated in the Consolidation
Agreement at issue in this arbitration.*?°

After the continuation of the bankruptcy proceedings in the Slovak courts, CSOB = 154
submitted another request for provisional measures. The Tribunal granted this request. It
noted the denial, by the Slovak courts, of CSOB’s request for suspension of the
bankruptcy proceedings and affirmed and extended its previous order. The Tribunal
recommended that the bankruptcy proceedings be suspended to the extent that they
might include determinations as to whether the Collection Company had made a loss
from the operating costs and the schedule of payments for the receivables assigned to it
by CSOB?”® (see also Art. 25, paras. 138-139).

In Pey Casado v Chile, the Claimants requested the stay of execution of a decision 155
of a Chilean Minister (so-called Decision No. 43) by way of a recommendation
for provisional measures in order to preserve their rights in the ICSID proceedings.
For the Claimants, Decision No. 43 represented a threat to the ICSID proceedings
because it decided a dispute that was identical or analogous to the one pending before
the Arbitral Tribunal. The Claimants further argued that the execution of this Decision
would amount to a rejection of the exclusive jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal to
rule on the issues before it and would have the effect of aggravating the terms of
the dispute.7’

1092 SCHREUER’S COMMENTARY ON THE ICSID CONVENTION

156 The Tribunal declined the request. It found that, although there were some common
elements, the dispute that formed the object of Decision No. 43 was clearly not identical
to the dispute submitted to ICSID, if only because the parties were not the same.*”* The
Tribunal added that the jurisdiction of an ICSID tribunal would prevail over any
inconsistent decision of a local court and concluded that, by virtue of the principle of
primacy of international procedures over internal procedures, Decision No. 43 was not
binding on the Tribunal, nor could it prevail over any decision the Tribunal might
render if it decided that it was competent to hear the merits of the claim.””” It followed
that the recommendation of provisional measures as requested was unnecessary and
inappropriate in the circumstances.”°?

157 In SGS v Pakistan, an agreement between the parties provided for national arbitration
in Pakistan. The Respondent initiated arbitration under this clause, whereas SGS
initiated ICSID arbitration. Pakistan applied to its courts to enjoin SGS from pursuing
the ICSID arbitration. In addition, Pakistan applied to the Supreme Court to hold SGS in
contempt of court. On 7 May 2002, SGS requested provisional measures from the
ICSID tribunal seeking the discontinuance of all proceedings relating to the ICSID
arbitration in the courts of Pakistan. SGS also requested a provisional measure to stay
the national arbitration.

158 On 3 July 2002, the Supreme Court of Pakistan rendered its decision, allowing the
Respondent to proceed with the local arbitration, and restraining the Claimant from
pursuing or participating in the ICSID arbitration. Although the Supreme Court did not
issue a notice of contempt, the possibility that SGS would be held in contempt of court
remained. The Claimant thereupon requested the ICSID tribunal to recommend that the
Respondent ‘remove’ or ‘undo’ this judgment.7*!

159 The ICSID tribunal issued its recommendation on 16 October 2002. It referred to its
power to determine its own competence in accordance with Art. 41 of the ICSID
Convention and ruled that the judgment of the Supreme Court of Pakistan was not
binding upon it. The Tribunal said:

It is essential for the proper operation of both the BIT and the ICSID Convention that
the right of access to international adjudication be maintained. In the Tribunal’s view, it
has a duty to protect this right of access and should exercise such powers as are vested
in it under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention in furtherance of that duty. ...

The right to seek access to international adjudication must be respected and cannot be
constrained by an order of a national court. Nor can a State plead its internal law in
defence of an act that is inconsistent with its international obligations. Otherwise, a
Contracting State could impede access to ICSID arbitration by operation of its own
law.7°?

160 With respect to Pakistan’s application to have SGS held in contempt of court, the
Tribunal requested Pakistan to refrain from acting on its earlier complaint or file a new
complaint. The Tribunal further asked Pakistan to ensure that no action be taken in
respect of contempt proceedings.***

Article 47 — Provisional Measures 1093

With regard to SGS’s request that Pakistan refrain from participating in proceedings 161
‘in any way’ relating to the arbitration in the future, the Tribunal found the request to be
too broad. It held that it could not “enjoin a State from conducting the normal process of
criminal, administrative and civil justice within its own territory.’*°*

With respect to SGS’s request for a stay of the national arbitration in Islamabad, the 162
Tribunal noted that it raised a number of substantial issues regarding the Tribunal’s
competence and jurisdiction. Nevertheless, having weighed up the different elements of
the case, the Tribunal decided that ‘it would be wasteful of resources for two proceed-
ings relating to the same or substantially the same matter to unfold separately while the
jurisdiction of one tribunal awaits determination.’?°> Therefore, it concluded that it
would be appropriate to recommend a stay of the Pakistani arbitration, until the Tribunal
had reached its decision on jurisdiction.?*©

The order for provisional measures in SGS v Pakistan was as follows: 163

First, the Tribunal recommends that the Government of Pakistan not take any step to
initiate a complaint for contempt. It recommends further that, in the event that any other
party, including the Supreme Court of Pakistan sua sponte, were to initiate a complaint,
the Government of Pakistan take all necessary steps to inform the Court of the current
standing of this proceeding and of the fact that this Tribunal must discharge its duty to
determine whether it has the jurisdiction to consider the international claim on the
merits. The Government of Pakistan should ensure that if contempt proceedings are
initiated by any party, such proceedings not be acted upon.

Second, the Tribunal recommends that the Islamabad-based arbitration pending
between the Government of Pakistan and SGS be stayed until such time, if any, as this
Tribunal has issued an award declining jurisdiction over the present dispute, and that
award is no longer capable of being interpreted, revised or annulled pursuant to the
ICSID Convention. The Tribunal requests that a copy of this procedural order be
transmitted to the designated arbitrator so that he is made fully aware of the status of
this international proceeding.”*’

In Zhinvali v Georgia, the Claimant filed a motion for a recommendation of provi- 164
sional measures under Arts. 26 and 47 of the Convention and Arbitration Rule 39 in
order to preserve its rights against a domestic litigation. The domestic litigation had
been introduced by Tbilisi Water Utilities Ltd. against the City of Tbilisi Government to
declare canceled an agreement between the parties to the ICSID proceedings. The
Claimant argued that the Georgia lawsuit was essentially a governmental entity suing
itself and that the purpose of the litigation was to take away from the ICSID tribunal the
decision as to the validity and effect of the agreement between the parties. The Claimant
added that it had been named as a ‘third person’ in the lawsuit in Georgia.”**

The Tribunal expressed its concern that the Georgian litigation may have an adverse 165
effect on the Claimant’s rights and interests, especially given its ‘third person’ status in
that litigation.’ Consequently, in light of the circumstances and of the pertinent
provisions of Arts. 26 and 47 of the Convention, the Tribunal recommended:

1094 SCHREUER’S COMMENTARY ON THE ICSID CONVENTION

(1) that the Georgia court stay and suspend its proceedings insofar as any issues pending
before the Tribunal were concerned and (2) that the Respondent immediately bring the
Tribunal’s recommendation to the attention of the Georgia court so that it might take
into account what appeared to the Tribunal as the ‘exclusive’ jurisdiction of ICSID over
issues that any final judgment in the Georgia lawsuit might otherwise implicate in a
manner that was prejudicial to the Claimant.*°

166 The Claimant subsequently informed the Tribunal that the higher court had vacated
the lower court’s judgment, declaring the agreement between the parties null and
void.7*!

167 In Tokios Tokelés v Ukraine, the Claimant requested the suspension of parallel
proceedings in Ukraine and investigations conducted by Ukrainian tax authorities
which, it argued, could seriously affect its rights.7** Holding that Ukraine had commit-
ted itself to the exclusivity of ICSID proceedings, and hence to the exclusion of
domestic judicial or administrative remedies, the Tribunal stated that parties ‘must
refrain from initiating or pursuing proceedings in any other forum in respect of the
subject-matter of the dispute before ICSID.’**° The Tribunal ruled, in relevant part:

The Tribunal has determined that in the present instance the circumstances require that
provisional measures be taken to preserve the respective rights of either party. The
Ukrainian authorities — whether judicial or other — are, therefore, under the legal
obligation to abstain from, and to suspend and discontinue, any proceedings before
any domestic body, whether judicial or other, which might in any way jeopardize the
principle of exclusivity of ICSID proceedings or aggravate the dispute before it.°*

168 The Tribunal decided as follows:

Pending the resolution of the dispute now before the Tribunal, both parties shall refrain
from, suspend and discontinue, any domestic proceedings, judicial or other, concerning
Tokios Tokelés or its investment in Ukraine, [. . .] which might prejudice the rendering
or implementation of an eventual decision or award of this Tribunal or aggravate the
existing dispute ...7*°

169 In Plama v Bulgaria, the Claimant filed a request for provisional measures, seeking
the discontinuance of insolvency proceedings brought by the Respondent before the
Bulgarian courts.~“° The Tribunal recognized that it was within its powers under Art. 47
of the Convention to recommend provisional measures in order to preserve the exclusiv-
ity of ICSID arbitration to the exclusion of local judicial remedies.**’ But the Tribunal
found that the claims and causes of action in the ICSID proceedings and in the
Bulgarian proceedings were different and concluded that the proceedings pending in
Bulgaria could not affect the outcome of the ICSID arbitration.*“* The Tribunal added

ICSID arbitration. It stated that it was ‘reluctant to recommend to a State that it order its
courts to deny third parties the right to pursue their judicial remedies.’**°

The Plama tribunal distinguished the situation before it from that in CSOB v_ 170
Slovakia, where the suspension of bankruptcy proceedings had been recommended.*”°
In CSOB, the Court might have made a determination on the right to receive funds
which was at issue in the arbitration. Moreover, in CSOB, there was a direct link
between the Slovak Republic, the Respondent in the ICSID arbitration, and the
Slovak Collection Agency, which was the subject of the Slovak bankruptcy proceedings
in which CSOB was the only named creditor.7>!

Although the Plama tribunal admitted that the proceedings in Bulgaria might aggra- 171
vate the dispute between the parties, it also considered ‘that the right to non-aggravation
of the dispute refers to actions which would make resolution of the dispute by the
Tribunal more difficult.’?>? Moreover, there was no urgency, since Plama’s claim was
limited to monetary damages. Therefore, whatever the outcome of the Bulgarian
proceedings, the Claimant’s right to pursue its monetary claims in the ICSID arbitration
would not be affected. The Tribunal concluded as follows:

The Tribunal accepts Respondent’s argument that harm is not irreparable if it can be
compensated for by damages, which is the case in the present arbitration and which,
moreover, is the only remedy Claimant secks.”°°

Therefore, the Plama tribunal rejected the Claimant’s request for provisional meas- 172
ures in its entirety.7>*

In Duke Energy v Peru, the Respondent’s request for provisional measures was not 173
directed at proceedings in the host State. The request asked the Tribunal to recommend
that the Claimant withdraw a petition it had filed before the United States Trade
Representative for the revocation or suspension of Peru’s beneficiary status under the
Andean Trade Preference Act. The request was withdrawn, however, without a decision
from the Tribunal.”

In Alghanim v Jordan, the Tribunal held that it was ‘well accepted that ICSID 174
tribunals may exercise their power to grant provisional measures in order to enforce
the exclusive remedy of ICSID proceedings.’*°° The Tribunal further held that, inter
alia, the ‘continued active progress of the Jordanian proceedings against Claimants,
which is prima facie inconsistent with the international obligation assumed by Jordan
under Art 26 of the ICSID Convention, does meet the requirement of urgency.’”>’ The
Tribunal ordered the Respondent to refrain from prosecuting its claims against the first
and second Claimants, and also ordered that the Claimants and Respondent jointly
request the Jordanian courts to suspend the proceedings.*°*

Tribunals have recognized that the obligation under Art. 26 to have exclusive 175
recourse to ICSID proceedings does not apply in the context of criminal proceedings.

1096 SCHREUER’S COMMENTARY ON THE ICSID CONVENTION

The right to exclusivity of ICSID proceedings under Article 26 of the ICSID Convention
can be protected by way of provisional measures. This right of exclusivity relates to the
resolution of investment disputes only and does not include or extend to criminal proceed-
ings which deal with criminal liability and not with investment disputes. As a result, in
principle, the criminal proceedings commenced by way of the Complaints and the Federal
Prosecutor’s preliminary investigation do not address the investment dispute before the
Tribunal and, therefore, do not threaten the exclusivity of these ICSID proceedings.”””

176 In numerous cases, such as SGS v Pakistan (see paras. 157—163) and Tokios Tokeleés v
Ukraine (see paras. 167-168 supra), the Claimant has requested provisional measures,
seeking an order that the Respondent State suspend or discontinue a criminal investi-
gation or prosecution involving the Claimant or persons connected with the Claimant.
Such provisional measures have been controversial, as they may interfere with the host
State’s sovereign right to undertake criminal investigations or prosecutions in respect of
crimes committed on its own territory. The Tribunal in SGS v Pakistan held that it could
not “enjoin a State from conducting the normal processes of criminal, administrative and
civil justice within its own territory. We cannot, therefore, purport to restrain the
ordinary exercise of these processes.’*°°

177 By contrast, various other tribunals have since expressed the view that they have the
power to order measures which seek to restrain criminal proceedings conducted by a
State. This has been justified on the basis that the language of Art. 47 is broad and does
not specify that any specific State action must be excluded from the scope of possible
provisional measures.7°! In doing so, however, these tribunals have made it clear that
claimants have to satisfy a more onerous burden.

178 In Caratube v Kazakhstan, the Claimant alleged that it had been subjected to ‘a
campaign of harassment, intimidation and persecution at the hands of the Kazakh
authorities,’ which constituted a breach of the Respondent’s obligations under the
Kazakhstan-United States BIT.*°* This conduct included criminal investigations, and
the seizure of the Claimant’s property. The Claimant requested provisional measures
under Art. 47, including a measure that the Respondent be ordered not to act ‘upon any
existing criminal complaints against the claimant, or file any new complaints.’*© In
considering the Claimant’s request, the Tribunal observed that ‘criminal investigations
and measures taken by a State . .. require particular consideration,’ and that they were ‘a
most obvious and undisputed part of the sovereign right of a State to implement and
enforce its national law on its territory.’*°* The Tribunal held that ‘a particularly
high threshold must be overcome before an ICSID tribunal can indeed recommend
provisional measures regarding criminal investigations conducted by a state.’?®

Article 47 — Provisional Measures 1097

The Tribunal ultimately rejected the Claimant’s request for provisional measures
concerning criminal proceedings, because the Claimant had not shown that ‘its proced-
ural right to continue with this ICSID arbitration [was] precluded by the criminal
investigation.’?°

In Quiborax v Bolivia, the Claimant commenced arbitral proceedings against the 179
Respondent over the latter’s revocation of mining concessions. Nine months after
reaching a settlement in 2008, the Respondent commenced criminal proceedings in
Bolivian courts against various shareholders of the Claimant company, citing the
alleged forgery of documents found during an audit conducted after proceedings had
begun in 2004. The Claimant sought provisional measures requiring the Respondent to
discontinue the criminal proceedings in Bolivia.*® In its decision, the Tribunal agreed
with previous tribunals (including that in Burlington v Ecuador, see para. 110 supra)
that the rights to be protected by provisional measures were not limited to those which
form the subject-matter of the dispute, but may extend to procedural rights, including
the general right to the preservation of the status quo and to the non-aggravation of the
dispute.*©* The relevant test is that the right to be preserved must ‘bear a relation with
the dispute.’

The Tribunal agreed with the Claimant that ‘the criminal proceedings may indeed be 180
impairing [their] right to present their case, in particular with respect to their access to
documentary evidence and witnesses.’*’° It noted that although the Claimants had
access to copies of some of their documents, they had been deprived of their records
and it was not clear whether the Claimants were ‘still missing relevant documentation
that might assist them in presenting their case on jurisdiction or the merits.’?’' The
Tribunal decided that the Respondent

shall take all appropriate measures to suspend the criminal proceedings in question, and
any other criminal proceedings directly related to the present arbitration, until this
arbitration is completed or until reconsideration of this decision, whether at the request
of a Party or of the Tribunal’s own motion.”

In Lao Holdings v Laos, a claim brought under the ICSID Additional Facility Rules, 181
the Tribunal issued a decision on provisional measures on 17 September 2013, in which it
enjoined the Respondent from demanding that the Claimant pay any amounts allegedly
due under the relevant tax legislation, and from instituting or further pursuing any action,
judicial or otherwise, to collect any payments under the relevant tax legislation,” or in
relation to the Claimant’s investment or funds.*”* It also enjoined the parties from taking
any steps that would alter the status quo ante or aggravate the dispute.””°

Laos subsequently made a request that the Tribunal amend its provisional measures 182
order, in order for it to be able to progress its criminal investigation into ‘alleged illegal
conduct by employees of the Claimant,’ as well as ‘alleged corruption of officials of the

Respondent Government’ in relation to the investments.*’° The Tribunal affirmed that
the Respondent had the sovereign power to investigate the legality of the way in which
the Claimants made their investment, and ‘to prosecute conduct that may constitute a
crime on its own territory if it has sufficient evidence to justify prosecution.’?””
However, the Tribunal declined to amend the provisional measures order, explaining
that there were ‘a number of exceptional circumstances in this case which lead the
Tribunal to depart from the general rule entitling a State to enforce on the national level
its criminal laws.’?’* In particular, the Tribunal considered that the Respondent’s
primary aim in carrying out a criminal investigation was ‘to collect evidence for use
at the arbitration, which, in the result, will undermine the integrity of the arbitral
process.’*’? The Tribunal emphasized that the cases were fact-sensitive, but considered
that ‘the “high threshold” allowing a tribunal to prevent a State from pursuing criminal
investigations in its national legal order’ had been overcome in the present case.7*°

183 In Churchill and Planet Mining v Indonesia, the Respondent’s authorities carried out
a raid on the premises of the Claimants’ local subsidiary, and the raid was allegedly
timed to take place at the time that the parties were attending a Tribunal-ordered
document inspection.**! The Claimants also alleged that the Respondent’s authorities
had harassed two of the Claimants’ subsidiary’s employees during the raid, and the
Respondent allegedly seized evidence relevant to this arbitration.“*? The Claimants
sought provisional measures to protect their rights in the arbitration proceedings, in
particular

their right to access evidence and to present their case through witness testimony, which
should not be impaired by (i) police raids on their premises, (ii) document seizures, and
(iii) criminal investigations or the threat of such investigations brought against wit-
nesses and potential witnesses.”*°

184 The Claimants submitted that the Respondent’s actions impaired their ‘right to the
preservation of the status quo and non-aggravation of the dispute’ and their ‘right to the
procedural integrity of the arbitration.’*°*

185 In its Procedural Order No 14, the Tribunal confirmed that ‘the right, even the duty, to
conduct criminal investigations and prosecutions is a prerogative of any sovereign
State.’**° It also noted that ‘ICSID tribunals have rightly held that when it comes to
criminal proceedings “a particularly high threshold must be overcome” before an ICSID
tribunal can recommend provisional measures.’**° In rejecting the Claimants’ request,
the Tribunal explained that:

An allegation that the status quo has been altered or that the dispute has been aggravated
needs to be buttressed by concrete instances of intimidation or harassment. On the basis

of the record as it presently stands, the Tribunal is of the view that the Claimants have
not met the burden of establishing conduct of this nature.7*’

In Hydro and others v Albania, the dispute concerned Albania’s alleged interference 186
with the Claimant’s investments by the launch of tax-audit and money-laundering
proceedings against the Claimant entities, the grant of preferential treatment to their
competitors, the seizure of certain accounts and arrest warrants, and threatened extradi-
tion of certain representatives of the Claimant.*** The Claimant sought provisional
measures requiring the Respondent to suspend the criminal proceedings until arbitration
was completed; to unfreeze bank accounts; to cease tax investigation; and to refrain
from any other investigations.”*? The Tribunal observed that, given the importance of a
sovereign State’s rights and duties to investigate and prosecute crime, ‘any obstruction
of the investigation or prosecution of conduct that is reasonably suspected to be criminal
in nature should only be ordered where that is absolutely necessary.’?”? The Tribunal
added that it would be less likely to intervene if the person was charged with an offense
‘totally unrelated to the factual circumstances of the dispute being arbitrated, such as
murder.’*”!

In Nova Group v Romania (see also paras. 42-43, 81 supra; para. 241 infra), the 187
Claimants sought provisional measures requiring Romania to, among other things,
suspend all criminal proceedings relating to the arbitration, to refrain from initiating
any other proceedings against the officers of its investment companies, and to withdraw
an arrest warrant and extradition request that had been submitted to the United Kingdom
in respect of one such officer.??” In response, Romania contended that tribunals did not
have the power to order provisional measures which would interfere with a State’s
sovereign right to prosecute individuals charged with crimes within its territory. In the
alternative, Romania argued that there are threshold requirements to satisfy in such
cases, namely that the domestic criminal proceedings must post-date the commence-
ment of the arbitration, and relate directly to the arbitral proceedings in the sense that
they are ‘impermissibly motivated to thwart the arbitration from progressing in any
meaningful fashion.’*?°

The Nova Group tribunal rejected Romania’s arguments. First, it affirmed that 189
provisional measures are an ‘exceptional remedy,’ and that tribunals should exercise
caution in granting such measures where they might constrain a State’s sovereign rights.
But it held that this caution should be taken into account in considering the relevant
factors, such as necessity and urgency, and that it was not ‘a threshold bar that prevents
the tribunal even from reaching those factors.’’°* Second, the Tribunal held that
although issues of the timing of and motivation for domestic criminal proceedings
may be important factors, these were not the only circumstances that are relevant to the
granting of provisional measures.”’° Ultimately, however, the Tribunal denied the

Claimant’s requests for provisional measures other than its request that Romania
withdraw the European arrest warrant and extradition request until the arbitration was
complete.?”°

190 Romania did not, however, withdraw the extradition request. In the United Kingdom
(where the sole director of Nova Group Investments BV was resident, whose extradition
was requested), a District Judge issued a judgment giving effect to the European arrest
warrant.”°’’ The Claimant’s director applied to the England and Wales High Court for
permission to appeal the judgment of the District Judge, including on the ground of
abuse of process (see para. 43 infra).?°* The High Court rejected permission to appeal
on this ground, and concluded that enforcement of Procedural Order No. 7 was “a matter
for the ICSID tribunal when it gives its final award (which it has not yet done) and not
for the Magistrates’ Court.’?”?

d) Orders for the Non-Aggravation of the Dispute
191 Note A to Arbitration Rule 39 in its 1968 version states that Art. 47

is based on the principle that once a dispute is submitted to arbitration the parties should
not take steps that might aggravate or extend their dispute or prejudice the execution of
the award.°”°

192 In Amco v Indonesia, Indonesia requested provisional measures to the effect that the
Claimants should desist from propaganda that might aggravate or extend the dispute.
The alleged publication of propaganda consisted of an article containing statements
attributed to a controlling shareholder of the Claimants, published in a Hong Kong
newspaper, which Indonesia found to be a ‘one-sided version of the Claimant’s story in
tones designed to be detrimental to international perceptions of the climate for foreign
investment in Indonesia.’°°! The Tribunal declined to make the recommendation. It
found that the article “could not have done any actual harm to Indonesia, nor aggravate
or exacerbate the legal dispute.’*°*

193 The Tribunal recognized the principle that the parties are under an obligation to avoid
any aggravation of the dispute. It referred to a rule according to which

both parties to a legal dispute should refrain, in their own interest, to do anything that
could aggravate or exacerbate the same, thus rendering its solution possibly more
difficult. However, in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal does not find any
symptom of an intention of the one or the other party to take steps that could have such
consequences; accordingly, the Tribunal does not deem it appropriate to issue a
recommendation to the parties. ...°°°

194 The Tribunal’s evaluation of the factual situation arising from the newspaper article
and its finding that no harm had been done creates the impression that, given the right

circumstances, it would have been prepared to recommend provisional measures against
an aggravation of the dispute.

In CSOB v Slovakia, the Claimant requested the Tribunal to recommend that the 195
Respondent take no action of any kind that might aggravate or further undermine the
dispute. The Tribunal denied this request finding that the Claimant had failed to
demonstrate the need for such a measure.°”*

In Pey Casado v Chile, the Claimants sought a general recommendation against the 196
aggravation of the dispute. The Tribunal noted that the Respondent did not dispute the
existence of a general principle to that effect; nor the Tribunal’s competence to order
provisional measures to avoid the aggravation or exacerbation of the dispute. It referred
to the established case law of the ICJ, the Iran—United States Claims Tribunal, and
ICSID tribunals.*°° Looking at the facts of that case, the Tribunal remarked on the
tension existing between the parties and recalled that its mission was to try and reduce
such tension, or at least prevent its aggravation during the proceedings.°°° Accordingly,
the Tribunal invited the parties to ‘prevent any act, of whatever nature, which could
aggravate or extend the dispute submitted to the Arbitral Tribunal.’*°”

In SGS v Pakistan, the Claimant’s application for provisional measures included a 197
request that the Respondent take no action that might aggravate or further extend the
dispute. The Tribunal concluded that there was no need to make such an order, since the
parties were cooperating and neither one of them had taken any measure to aggravate
the dispute.°”*

In Azurix v Argentina, the Claimant alleged that, once it had initiated ICSID arbitra- 198
tion, the Argentinian Province had taken a series of measures harassing it. This included
action taken by the Province in bankruptcy proceedings initiated by the Claimant to
protect its interests.°° The Claimant relied on a ‘universally admitted principle of
international law that the parties to an international case are obliged to abstain from
adopting measures that might aggravate or extend the dispute.’*’° Therefore, the
Claimant asked for a provisional measure recommending Argentina to refrain from
any action or omission capable of aggravating or extending the dispute.*"’

The Azurix tribunal recognized the validity of the principle of non-aggravation or 199
non-extension of the dispute.*!” Although the request was couched in general terms, its
objective was stated with sufficient precision to meet the requirement of a “specific
measure.’ The Tribunal invited the parties ‘to abstain from adopting measures of any
character that could aggravate or extend the controversy submitted to this arbitration.’*!°

In Plama v Bulgaria, the Claimant also requested an order to have the Respondent 200
take no action that might aggravate or further extend the dispute.*'* The principal thrust
of the request for provisional measures was directed against insolvency proceedings
against Plama and the execution of tax debts. The Claimant argued that these actions

would lead to the aggravation of the dispute.*'> The Tribunal confirmed that provisional
measures are appropriate to prevent parties from taking measures which might aggravate
or extend the dispute or render its resolution more difficult.?'® However, the right to
non-aggravation must be related to the specific dispute in arbitration.*'’ Although the
domestic proceedings may well, in a general sense, aggravate the dispute between
the parties, the subject-matter of these proceedings was different from the claims
before the Tribunal.*'® Therefore, the Tribunal rejected the request for provisional
measures.

In Occidental v Ecuador, the Tribunal confirmed that provisional measures can be
granted to avoid aggravation of the dispute. However, provisional measures are not an
appropriate means to mitigate damages. The Tribunal observed that, in any situation
resulting from an illegal act, the mere passage of time aggravates the damages that can
ultimately be granted. Where the only harm is more damage, the appropriate remedy is
monetary compensation, and not provisional measures.*!?

Subsequent tribunals have also agreed that they can grant provisional measures to
avoid the aggravation or exacerbation of the dispute. In Biwater Gauff v Tanzania, the
Tribunal held that it was ‘settled in both treaty and international commercial arbitration
that an arbitral tribunal is entitled to direct the parties not to take any step that might (1)
harm or prejudice the integrity of the proceedings, or (2) aggravate or exacerbate the
dispute.’°7°

In Burlington v Ecuador, the Tribunal held that:

the rights to be preserved by provisional measures are not limited to those which form
the subject-matter of the dispute or substantive rights as referred to by the Respondents,
but may extend to procedural rights, including the general right to the status quo and to
the non-aggravation of the dispute.*”"

In Gabriel Resources v Romania, the Tribunal also agreed that it could order
provisional measures to ensure the non-aggravation of the dispute.°*7”

e) Orders Relating to the Confidentiality of the Proceedings

Confidentiality and transparency in arbitration proceedings are two conflicting prin-
ciples. Their respective weight in ICSID arbitration has been the subject-matter of some
debate. These principles are discussed in other parts of this Commentary (see Art. 44,
paras. 141-174; Art. 48, paras. 127-155). In some cases, parties have sought to have the
confidentiality of proceedings protected through provisional measures (see also Art. 44,
paras. 155, 157-158, 162-167).

In Amco v Indonesia, the Respondent claimed that a newspaper article attributed to a
controlling shareholder of the Claimants was incompatible with the spirit of

confidentiality of the proceedings, in particular with Art. 48(5) of the Convention and
Arbitration Rules 6(2), 15, 31(2), 37(2), and 48(4).°?? The Tribunal rejected this
argument by pointing out that the Convention and Rules do not prevent the parties
from revealing their case.°”*

In Biwater Gauff v Tanzania, the Claimant alleged that Tanzania had allowed certain 207
documents from the arbitration to be published on the internet (which Tanzania
admitted).*”° The Claimant requested provisional measures that:

for the duration of the arbitration proceedings, the parties refrain from taking any steps
which might undermine the procedural integrity, or the orderly working, of the arbitral
process and/or which might aggravate or exacerbate the dispute.*7°

In particular, the Claimant sought orders that the parties: “undertake to discuss ona 208
case by case basis the publication of all Decisions other than the Award made in the
course of the proceedings’; ‘refrain from disclosing to third parties any of the
Pleadings’; ‘refrain from disclosing to third parties any of the documents’ produced
in disclosure process; and refrain from disclosing any of their correspondence.*”’

The Biwater tribunal considered the provisions of the ICSID Convention and the 209
Administrative and Financial Regulations and Rules, which only contained ‘limitations
on specific aspects of confidentiality and privacy.’*?* The Tribunal concluded that,

[i]Jn the absence of any agreement between the parties on this issue, there is no provision
imposing a general duty of confidentiality in ICSID arbitration, whether in the ICSID
Convention, any of the applicable Rules or otherwise. Equally, however, there is no
provision imposing a general rule of transparency or non-confidentiality in any of these
329
sources.
The Tribunal nonetheless considered that it could direct the parties ‘not to take any 210
step that might (1) harm or prejudice the integrity of the proceedings, or (2) aggravate or

exacerbate the dispute.’*°° It further explained that:

It is self-evident that the prosecution of a dispute in the media or in other public fora, or
the uneven reporting and disclosure of documents or other parts of the record in parallel
with a pending arbitration, may aggravate or exacerbate the dispute and may impact
upon the integrity of the procedure. This is all the more so in very public cases, such as
this one, where issues of wider interest are raised, and where there is already substantial
media coverage, some of which already being the subject of complaint by the parties.**!

The Tribunal observed that the risks to the integrity of the arbitral proceedings, and 211
the danger of an aggravation or exacerbation of this dispute, had not yet manifested
themselves in concrete terms, but the Tribunal held that there was no requirement for the

harm to be manifested before it could adopt any measures.**” It concluded that it was
‘satisfied that there exists a sufficient risk of harm or prejudice, as well as aggravation,
in this case to warrant some form of control,’ although it considered that any restrictions
had to be ‘carefully and narrowly delimited.’*** It then set out the terms of its order,
which permitted the parties to engage in public discussion about the case, but directed
that they were not to publish any pleadings, memorials, minutes or records of hearings,
witness statements, expert reports, documentary exhibits produced by the other party,
and correspondence.*** The parties were permitted to apply to the Tribunal in respect of
the publication of its decisions, procedural orders, and directions.**>

212 In World Duty Free v Kenya, the Respondent’s Request for Provisional Measures
invoked a general principle of confidentiality that would prevent either party from
discussing the proceedings publicly. The Tribunal noted that neither the Convention
nor the Arbitration Rules contain an express restriction with regard to the parties’
freedom to discuss the arbitration and added that

[e]specially in an arbitration to which a Government is a Party, it cannot be assumed
that the Convention and the Rules incorporate a general obligation of confidentiality
which would require the Parties to refrain from discussing the case in public.**°

213 Nevertheless, the Tribunal directed the parties to avoid any action that ‘would
aggravate or exacerbate the dispute’ and that ‘any public discussion should be an
accurate report.’*°”

214 The Request also raised the issue of privacy of the hearings to the extent that Kenya
complained that the minutes and audio-recordings of the preliminary session had been
disseminated to the press, without a prior request to open the hearings to the media. The
Tribunal noted that the question is regulated by Rule 32(2) of the Arbitration Rules and
ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 22, providing, respectively, that tribu-
nals decide only with the consent of the parties who can attend hearings and whether
minutes and records of proceedings will be published. The Tribunal concluded that
“when no decision has been taken to open the hearings to the public, the records of such
hearings should not be disseminated unilaterally by one of the Parties.’*°* Since no such
decision had been made in that case, the Tribunal stated that the relevant minutes and
audio-recordings may not be disseminated to the public by one of the parties.*°?

215 In United Utilities v Estonia, the Respondent applied for provisional measures
requiring the Claimant not to publish any further part of the arbitration material, after
the Claimant published an extract of its Memorial.**° The Tribunal considered that the
right the Respondent was seeking to protect was in essence its right for the procedural
integrity of the arbitration to be respected and the non-aggravation of the dispute.** The
Tribunal ordered that:

no party is prevented from engaging in general discussion about the case in public ...
provided that such public discussion is not used as an instrument to antagonise any
party, exacerbate the parties’ differences, aggravate the dispute, disrupt the proceedings
or unduly pressure any party.**”

It further ordered that such public discussion may not include ‘publication of the 216
“Arbitration Documents”, i.e., the documents filed in this arbitration, such as the
parties’ written submissions, witness statements, expert reports and documents pro-
duced within the framework of document production, or any excerpt or extract
thereof.’**°

In Ipek v Turkey (see Art. 44, paras. 172-174), the Tribunal held that its powers under 217
Art. 47 extend to imposing restrictions on publication where deemed necessary in order
not to exacerbate the dispute, breach the confidentiality of particular documents in the
proceedings, or otherwise impair the right of both parties to a fair hearing.*** However,
as these provisional measures were not sought in the particular case, no factual analysis
was undertaken.

3. The Addressees of Provisional Measures

Neither the Convention nor the Arbitration Rules indicate to whom provisional 218
measures may be addressed. During the negotiations leading to the Convention, the
question was raised to whom the tribunal would direct its recommendations.

Mr. Broches stated that the recommendations would be made to the parties (History,
Vol. II, p. 814).

In the context of Art. 47, there is no provision analogous to Art. 54 of the Convention 219
which would require each Contracting State to recognize and enforce provisional
measures. But an involvement of third States and their courts**° cannot be ruled out
entirely. Situations may arise in which evidence, assets, or objects, which are essential
for the proceedings, are located in a State other than the State party to the dispute.
Proceedings that have a bearing on an ICSID arbitration case may be pending in the
courts of third States. It would be extraordinary if in the face of such a situation a
tribunal would be entirely powerless to make a recommendation beyond the parties to
the dispute, even if such recommendations were not binding on such third persons or
national courts.

The reaction of a domestic court in a third State to a recommendation for provisional 220
measures would depend very much on the specific situation and on the claim put
forward. However, such a court should not dismiss the invocation of an ICSID tribu-
nal’s provisional measures offhand. To the extent that legal consequences arise from
provisional measures, all Contracting States are under a general obligation to ensure in
good faith that the Convention’s object and purpose are not frustrated.

Requests for provisional measures have invariably sought provisional measures 221
directed at the other party. Whenever tribunals have recommended provisional meas-
ures, they were directed at one or both of the parties to the proceedings before them.

1106 SCHREUER’S COMMENTARY ON THE ICSID CONVENTION

222 International law sees a State and its organs as one unit. For purposes of State
responsibility, the conduct of a State organ, whether it exercises legislative, executive,
judicial, or any other functions, is attributable to the State.**° Therefore, even though a
State will normally be represented in ICSID arbitration by the executive, provisional
measures are also directed at the other organs of the State. In CSOB v Slovakia, the
Tribunal called upon the parties to the ICSID arbitration to bring its Order recommend-
ing provisional measures to the attention of the appropriate judicial authorities of the
Slovak Republic so that they may act accordingly.**”

4. The Rights in Dispute

223 A recurrent theme is the relationship of the rights to be protected through provisional
measures to the rights in dispute between the parties. The references in the travaux
préparatoires to the preservation of the status quo are an expression of the principle that
in the course of litigation the parties must refrain from taking steps that might affect the
rights of the other side which are the object of the proceedings on the merits. This is
particularly so where an ongoing legal relationship remains in existence or where a
business is at stake, which may be damaged through unilateral action, or an attempt at
self-help. Therefore, the rights to be protected through provisional measures must relate
to the rights in dispute between the parties. At the same time, provisional measures must
not prejudge the rights to be determined by the tribunal’s decision on the merits.

224 Under Art. 1134 of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), interim
measures of protection may be granted to preserve the rights of a disputing party, or to
ensure that the Tribunal’s jurisdiction is made fully effective, including ‘an order for the
preservation of evidence in the possession or control of a disputing party or to protect
the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.’*“* But attachments and injunctions may not be used against
measures alleged to be in violation of the NAFTA.

225 In Holiday Inns v Morocco, the Tribunal, in its Decision on Provisional Measures of
2 July 1972, was primarily concerned with preserving the existing contractual rights. It
called upon the parties to abstain from measures likely to prevent the execution of their
obligations and from measures incompatible with the upholding of the contract in the
following terms:

Both Parties are invited to abstain from any measure incompatible with the upholding of
the Contract and to make sure that the action already taken should not result in any
consequences in the future which would go against such upholding.*”

226 The Tribunal’s decision, as reported by Lalive, continued as follows:

A second recommendation, formulated in a carefully balanced manner, concerns the
exchange of information by the parties regarding the management of the completed
hotels and the completion of those hotels still to be constructed. In a third and last

recommendation, the Tribunal, taking special account of one of the claimants’ com-
plaints, recommended consultations ‘in order to maintain in the hotels the character of

the enterprise which is part of the international chain of Holiday Inns Hotels’.*”°

In Amco v Indonesia, the Government’s request invoked a number of rights, none of 227
which were directly related to the rights in dispute. They were the non-aggravation of
the dispute through an adverse newspaper report, the exclusive nature of ICSID
arbitration and the confidential nature of the proceedings. In rejecting the request, the
Tribunal emphasized that the rights to which Art. 47 of the Convention relates are the
rights in dispute which could not be affected by the newspaper article:

Claimants rightly point out that Rule 39(1), implementing the very general provision of
Art. 47 of the Convention, requires the party which solicits a provisional measure to
specify the rights that such measure would be purported to preserve. Obviously, the
rights to which this provision is relating are the rights in dispute, and no such right
could be threatened by the publication of articles like those which are produced by both
parties. Moreover, it cannot be seriously contended that the article in The Hong Kong
Business Standard may have whatever influence on Indonesia’s economy.

It might possibly be that a large press campaign could have such an influence.
However, even so, it would not be an influence on rights in dispute.*?!

In Maffezini v Spain, the Respondent had requested a guaranty bond to cover the 228
expected procedural costs. The Tribunal analyzed the language of Rule 39(1) and
concluded that it concerned existing rights, such as rights in property whose ownership
is disputed, and not rights to be created in the future. Applying this analysis to the case
before it, the Tribunal considered that there were no present rights to be preserved
because the request for relief hinged on hypothetical questions relating to future
events.*°” In dismissing the application for provisional measures, the Tribunal said:

Any preliminary measure to be ordered by an ICSID arbitral tribunal must relate to the
subject matter of the case before the tribunal and not to separate, unrelated issues or
extraneous matters.*”*

The Claimants in Pey Casado v Chile requested the stay of the execution of a 229
decision of a Chilean Ministry. Chile objected that this request would prejudge the
substance of the case. The Tribunal entered into a discussion on whether the existence
of ‘real and present rights,’ as distinguished from hypothetical or conditional rights, was
a condition for the recommendation of provisional measures. The Tribunal emphasized
that a decision on provisional measures would not prejudge the substance of the case.
Rather, it would have to proceed on the basis of hypotheses as to the recognition of the
rights in dispute and the possible danger of these rights in the absence of provisional
measures. The Tribunal distanced itself from the language used by the Maffezini

1108 SCHREUER’S COMMENTARY ON THE ICSID CONVENTION

tribunal, which it found susceptible to being misunderstood.*** The Tribunal summar-
ized its position as follows:

To demand that the right that one seeks to preserve must be existing, demonstrated or
proved ‘at the time of the claim’ can certainly, in certain circumstances, be seen as
raising no difficulties. On the other hand, in other circumstances, it could, ex natura
rerum, oblige the Tribunal to prejudge the substance, at a time when it is not yet in a
position to judge it, and in hypotheses which, by definition, cannot be used to affirm or
prove the existence or reality of the right invoked until later, by the judgment on the
merits of the case.*°°

230 Nevertheless, the Tribunal declined the request for provisional measures because it
found that the dispute forming the object of the Ministerial decision was not identical to
the dispute before it.

231 In Azurix v Argentina, Azurix, by way of provisional measures, sought to protect the
right of its locally incorporated investment vehicle, ABA, to continue judicial proceed-
ings in Argentina.*°° The Respondent, for its part, contended that the dispute between
ABA and the Province of Buenos Aires was different ratione materiae and ratione
personae from the ICSID dispute. The Tribunal noted that the Claimant’s ability as a
US investor to enforce rights of ABA and the international responsibility of Argentina
for actions of its province were central issues in the arbitration. Accordingly, the
question of whether the granting of provisional measures was appropriate or not
depended on merits issues. In the circumstances, the Tribunal held that it was not in a
position to recommend the measure requested because doing so ‘would inevitably lead
the Tribunal to prejudge the merits of the case.’*°’

232 In Plama v Bulgaria, the Claimant requested provisional measures to protect its
investment against insolvency proceedings.*°* The Tribunal stated that provisional
measures must relate to the preservation of the requesting party’s rights.°°? Not any
and all rights of a party may be thus protected. In the Tribunal’s view, a limitation such
as ‘rights relating to the dispute’ was reasonable and necessary. The Tribunal said:

Thus the rights to be preserved by provisional measures are circumscribed by the
requesting party’s claims and requests for relief. They may be general rights, such as
the rights to due process or the right not to have the dispute aggravated, but those
general rights must be related to the specific disputes in arbitration, which, in turn, are
defined by the Claimant’s claims and requests for relief to date.*©°

233 In the particular case, the Claimant’s claims and requests for relief were limited to
damages. Therefore, the Tribunal found that the scope of the rights in dispute in the
ICSID proceedings to be protected by provisional measures was limited to the damages
claims.*°! The domestic proceedings concerned different parties, different claims, and
different requests for relief.°°* The Tribunal held that the harm invoked by Plama to

justify its request for provisional measures was not irreparable since it could be
compensated by damages, which were the only remedy sought by Plama in the
ICSID  arbitration.°°? Therefore, the Tribunal rejected the request for
provisional measures.

In Occidental v Ecuador, the Claimant requested a number of provisional measures 234
that were designed to secure the eventual restitution of assets that had been taken from
the investor.*** The Tribunal looked at the existence of rights of the Claimant deserving
protection. It found that a right may not yet have been recognized by the Tribunal, but
may nevertheless be deserving of protection by way of provisional measures. The right
must potentially form part of the Claimant’s rights.°°° The requested provisional
measures were predicated on the assumption that the Claimant had a right to specific
performance or restitution.*

In the particular case, the Tribunal found specific performance to be impossible. 235
Where a State had in the exercise of its sovereign powers put an end to a contract or
license, specific performance was legally impossible. Reinstatement of a concession
after nationalization or termination would be a disproportionate interference with the
sovereignty of the State. The appropriate remedy would be monetary compensation.*°’

Since the Claimants had not established a strongly arguable case for the existence of a
right to specific performance, it was not appropriate for the Tribunal to grant a provi-
sional measure for the protection of such a right.°°

In Quiborax v Bolivia, the Claimants sought provisional measures for the mainten- 236
ance of the status quo, the non-aggravation of the dispute, and the procedural integrity
of the arbitration proceedings, which involved ordering the suspension of criminal
proceedings.°© The Tribunal agreed that the rights which were capable of being
preserved by an order for provisional measures were ‘not limited to those which form
the subject-matter of the dispute, but may extend to procedural rights, including the
general right to the preservation of the status quo and to the non-aggravation of the
dispute.’*”° It recommended that the Respondent ‘take all appropriate steps to suspend
the criminal proceedings’ in question.*”!

In Churchill Mining v Indonesia, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal recom- 237
mend provisional measures that the Claimant ‘refrain from making false, unfounded and
misleading statements in the media regarding the case at hand,’ and ‘refrain from
approaching and/or persuading and/or inducing any officials [of] the Government of
the Republic of Indonesia to enter into any “amicable” settlement outside the present
arbitration proceedings.’*”* It asserted that this was necessary to protect rights that were
in dispute, including ‘the right to welcome foreign investors to invest in its territory,’

‘the right to regulate and promote investments in its natural resources,’ and ‘the right to
protection of its honour and reputation.’*’* The Tribunal confirmed (referring to Plama

v Bulgaria) that the rights to be preserved by way of provisional measures needed to
bear a relation with the dispute.*’* It rejected the Respondent’s request, finding that
these were ‘not rights in dispute that could warrant the recommendation of provisional
measures.”>”>

In RSM v St Lucia, the Respondent’s request for provisional measures was an
application for security for costs.°’° The Tribunal characterized this request as being
for the preservation for a procedural right and a contingent right which would only arise
if and when the Tribunal found that the Respondent had prevailed on the merits and was
entitled to an award of costs.*”’ The Tribunal held that the rights which are sought to be
protected by way of provisional measures ‘need not already exist at the time the request
is made ... future or conditional rights such as the potential claim for cost reimburse-
ment qualify as “rights to be preserved”.>"*

In Niko Resources v Bangladesh, the Claimant sought orders from the Tribunal on the
implementation of the Tribunal’s decision on its claim for payment. The Tribunal
rejected the Claimant’s request, finding that the measures sought by the Claimant were
‘intended to give effect to the Claimant’s rights themselves and [were] not measures
intended to protect these rights subject to a future decision by the Tribunals.’*’” For the
Tribunal, this meant that they were ‘not provisional measures in the sense of Article
47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.’**°

The Tribunal in Lighthouse Corp v Timor-Leste agreed that the rights sought to be
protected “can be substantive or procedural in nature and need not necessarily exist at
the time of the request. Indeed, the application may well serve to protect contingent
rights.’°*!

In Nova Group v Romania (see paras. 42-43, 81, 187-190 supra), the Tribunal
appeared to disagree. The Claimant in that case sought provisional measures for the
suspension of criminal proceedings against the officers of the Claimant, including its
director, and the withdrawal of a European arrest warrant. The Tribunal held that ‘the
nature of “rights” within the meaning of Article 47, is that these must be entitlements
that exist at the time of the application.’**?

This survey of practice shows highly differentiated attitudes of tribunals towards the
relationship between the rights to be protected by way of provisional measures and the
rights in dispute between the parties. Tribunals have generally confirmed that the rights
which can be the subject of provisional measures include substantive and procedural
rights (e.g. Plama, Quiborax, and RSM). Some tribunals either granted provisional
measures seeing that they related to the rights in dispute (Holiday Inns) or denied them
because they did not relate to the rights in dispute (Amco, Maffezini, Plama, Churchill
Mining). The Occidental tribunal went as far as examining the right claimed by the
applicant. Since the right in question did not exist, provisional measures relating to it

were declined. By contrast, in other cases, the close relationship of the requested
measures to the rights in dispute was a reason for declining provisional measures.
The tribunals pointed out that the requested measures would have amounted to a
provisional performance of the claim at issue, or might prejudge the merits of the case
(Pey Casado, Azurix, Niko Resources).

E. ‘... of either party.’

The qualifying phrase ‘of either party’ refers to the rights to be protected and not to 243
the addressee of the recommendation. Therefore, it does not answer the question
whether recommendations are necessarily restricted in their effect to the parties in
the proceedings.

1. Investor Rights and Host State Rights

The most distinctive characteristic of ICSID is the mixed nature of the proceedings 244
invariably involving a State party and a non-State party. This raises the question
whether tribunals in their practice on provisional measures are more sensitive towards
States’ rights than towards the rights of investors. An overall survey of cases in which
requests have been made for provisional measures does not show any particular
inclination in favor or against the granting of provisional measures requested by one
or the other party. ICSID has published a table of decisions on provisional measures
which provides information on whether the request for provisional measures in the
cases was successful or not.**°

2. Rights of Third Parties

In a number of cases, the requests for provisional measures were directed primarily at 245
the preservation of rights of third parties. The tribunals had to decide whether these
third-party rights were sufficiently closely related to the rights of one of the parties to the
disputes before them.

In Pey Casado v Chile, the Claimants requested the stay of execution of a Ministerial 246
Decision by way of a provisional measure. One of the reasons the Tribunal gave for
declining this request was the fact that the Ministerial Decision concerned different
parties.°**

In Azurix v Argentina, the adverse measures against which the request for provisional 247
measures was directed concerned ABA, a corporation registered in Argentina, through
which the Claimant carried out its investment (see para. 231 supra). The Tribunal noted
that, under Arbitration Rule 39(1), the rights to be preserved had to be rights of the
parties. The request for provisional measures indicated that the right to be preserved
would be the right of ABA. Argentina argued that ABA, as a third party, could not
benefit from provisional measures. The Tribunal noted that under the Argentina—United
States BIT only Azurix had party status. The relationship of the rights of ABA to Azurix
was under dispute between the parties. The Tribunal found that answering these

1112 SCHREUER’S COMMENTARY ON THE ICSID CONVENTION

questions would lead it to prejudge the merits of the case. Therefore, the Tribunal was
not in a position to recommend the provisional measure.**°

248 In Plama v Bulgaria, the request for provisional measures was directed against
insolvency proceedings in Bulgaria. The insolvency proceedings concerned Nova
Plama, a locally incorporated company owned by the Claimant. The Tribunal, rejecting
the request, noted that the insolvency proceedings could not affect the outcome of the
ICSID arbitration. It found it significant that the parties to the bankruptcy proceedings
and the parties to the arbitration before it were different. In particular, the bankruptcy
proceedings had been brought by private persons unconnected to the ICSID
arbitration.°*°

249 In Zhinvali v Georgia, the request for provisional measures was directed against
domestic litigation between two government-controlled entities. The apparent purpose
of the domestic lawsuit was to declare canceled an agreement between the Claimant and
the Respondent in the ICSID arbitration. Zhinvali enjoyed the status of a ‘third person’
in the Georgia lawsuit. The Tribunal granted provisional measures directing that the
Georgia court stay and suspend its proceedings insofar as they concerned issues pending
before the ICSID tribunal.**’
